# TASK #
You will receive:
- Three sets of simulation descriptions from 3 AIs, each containing:
   1. **The blocks used in the simulation:** A list of blocks utilized in the simulation.
   2. **Connections Description:** A detailed description of how the blocks are connected, with each connection formatted as:
      ```
      BlockA (Real Block Name) PortX (related parameter setting to match the port number) <-> BlockB (Real Block Name) PortY (related parameter setting to match the port number)
      ```
      **Note:** PortX and PortY are the real internal port names (not the visual labels); BlockA and BlockB are the block labels shown in the diagram; and the Real Block Name corresponds to the block names from the simulation blocks list.

Your task is to:
- Re-examine the simulation diagram.
- Evaluate and score each of the three sets of descriptions (AI1, AI2, and AI3) based on correctness, completeness, and adherence to the simulation diagram.
- Score each component on a scale of 5 points:
   - **The blocks used in the simulation:** (score out of 5)
   - **Connections Description:** (score out of 5)
- Provide a brief justification for each score.

# INPUT #
- **AI1 Description:**  
  {ai1_description}

- **AI2 Description:**  
  {ai2_description}

- **AI3 Description:**  
  {ai3_description}

# RESPONSE #
Provide a final report with your evaluation, and at the end output a JSON formatted object with the scores for each description, broken down into the two components. For example:
```json
{
  "AI1": {
    "The blocks used in the simulation": 5,
    "Connections Description": 4
  },
  "AI2": {
    "The blocks used in the simulation": 4,
    "Connections Description": 4
  },
  "AI3": {
    "The blocks used in the simulation": 3,
    "Connections Description": 3
  }
}
```

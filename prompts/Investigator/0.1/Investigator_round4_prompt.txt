# TASK #
Now that the simulation has been successfully executed without errors, please write a comprehensive report **strictly** addressing the following four key questions:

1. **What is the simulation about?**  
   Describe the purpose, context, and overall objective of the simulation. What real-world system or process does it aim to model?

2. **What are the main implementation steps?**  
   Break down the simulation into clear stages or functional modules. Describe how the process is structured step-by-step.

3. **What theoretical knowledge and mathematical modelling are involved in each step?**  
   For each implementation step, explain the corresponding theoretical background and mathematical modelling(e.g., control theory, physical modeling, signal flow, system dynamics, etc.).

4. **How is it implemented in code?**  
   Provide and explain the corresponding code for **each step (you can re-order the code to strictly follow each step)**. Highlight how the code reflects both the theory and the simulation diagram.

The final report should integrate both theoretical analysis and full code explanations. Ensure that the structure of the explanation aligns clearly with the four sections above. Do not ask any clarifying questions.

**Important Note:** **DO NOT need to clarify and changes from the reviewer's feddback**

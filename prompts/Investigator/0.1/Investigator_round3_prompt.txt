- **Simulation Blocks Description:**  
  {simulation_blocks_list}

# TASK #
Your tasks are to:

- Analyze the **Unit Test Reviewer Feedback**.
- Re-analyze the simualtion diagram, especially the connections.
- Re-read the Simulation Blocks' **Simulation Blocks Description** that includes the block type and port description.
- Generate a revised connection description that addresses all issues raised in the feedback. If you are suggested to remove a certain connectection, just **DO NOT** show it again, rahter than show it again and clarify it is removed.**MUST STRICTLY Format** each connection description as:  

  BlockA (BlockA's block type) PortX (**related parameter setting to match the port number if necessary**)<-> BlockB (BlockB's block type) PortY (**related parameter setting to match the port number if necessary**)
  
   **Note:** 
  1.Left side of '<->' is output port, while right side of '<->' is input port, never flip the relationship. **In most of cases, the same Input port MUST NOT be connected more than one time (with **ONLY** the exception of Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration).** For example, if you identify there is a Constant block that is connected to 2 different Gain block, you should describe them as:
  
  '''
  Constant 1 (Constant) 1 <-> Gain 1 (Gain) 1
  Constant 1 (Constant) 1 <-> Gain 2 (Gain) 1
  '''
  
  rather than,
  
  '''
  Gain 1 (Gain) 1 <-> Constant 1 (Constant)
  Gain 2 (Gain) 1 <-> Constant 1 (Constant)
  '''
  
  similarly, if you see the port LConn2 of a Current-Controlled Current Source are connected to both the port LConn 1 of a Resistor and the port LConn1 of a Voltage Sensor, you should describe these connections as:
  
  '''
  CCCS 1 (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2 <-> Resistor 1 (Resistor) LConn1
  CCCS 1 (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2 <-> Voltage Sensor 1 (Voltage Sensor) LConn1
  '''
  
  rather than,
  
  '''
  Resistor 1 (Resistor) LConn1 <-> CCCS 1 (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2
  Voltage Sensor 1 (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 <-> CCCS 1 (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2
  '''
  
  
  2.PortX and PortY are the real internal port names, BlockA and BlockB are the block name shown in the diagram.
  
  3.Any **parameters related to the number of port** need to be declared, for example:
  
     Gain 2 (Gain) 1 <-> Sum (Sum) 1 (`Inputs` = `++-`), where the port number of Sum depends on `Inputs`, so it needs to be clarified, while the port number of Gain is fixed, so no parameters need to be clarified.
  
**IMPORTANT:** 
- **ONLY** use the below listed blocks, and **ALL** listed blocks should be used. **If reviewer's feedback mentioned some blocks were listed but unused, and they are still listed on the last round, you SHOULD NEVER remove them, you should try to include them in the connection description properly.**

# RESPONSE #
Directly provide a complete and revised connection description that resolves the issues identified in the feedback. Do not ask any clarifying questions or confirmations.

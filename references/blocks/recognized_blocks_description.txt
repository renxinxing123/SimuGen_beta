## Busbar

**Path:** `'ee_lib/Connectors & References/Busbar'`

**Ports:**

- When **`n_nodes`** is set to **1**, the exposed port is:  
  - **LConn1**

- When **`n_nodes`** is set to **2**, the exposed ports are:  
  - **LConn1**  
  - **RConn1**

- When **`n_nodes`** is set to **3**, the exposed ports are:  
  - **LConn1**  
  - **RConn1**  
  - **LConn2**

- When **`n_nodes`** is set to **4**, the exposed ports are:  
  - **LConn1**  
  - **RConn1**  
  - **LConn2**  
  - **RConn2**

*In the visual simulation blocks, the port labels correspond as follows:*  
- **LConn1** appears as **~1**.  
- **RConn1** appears as **~2**.  
- **LConn2** appears as **~3**.  
- **RConn2** appears as **~4**.

**~1, ~2, ~3, ~4 are just port label for recognition, NOT port name, only use **LConn1** ,**RConn1** ,**LConn2**  ,**RConn2****.

**Ports:**

The block provides a total of four ports:
- **LConn1:** First port (typically representing the sending-end phase connection).
- **RConn1:** Second port (typically representing the sending-end phase connection).
- **LConn2:** Third port (ONLY ground connection).
- **RConn2:** Fourth port (ONLY ground connection).

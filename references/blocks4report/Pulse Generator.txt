## Pulse Generator

**Path:** `'simulink/Sources/Pulse Generator'`

**Description:**  
The Pulse Generator block outputs pulses based on the following logic:

```
if (t >= PhaseDelay) && (Pulse is on)
   Y(t) = Amplitude
else
   Y(t) = 0
end
```

The Pulse type parameter determines the computational technique used. Use Time-based for variable step solvers, and Sample-based for fixed step solvers or for discrete portions within a variable step solver model.

**Ports:**

- **Output Port:** **1** (no visual label)

## Sum

**Path:** `'simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Sum'`

**Description:**  
Add or subtract inputs. Specify one of the following methods to define the operation:  
a) A character vector containing **+** or **-** for each input port, with **|** as a spacer between groups (e.g., `++|-|++`).  
b) A scalar (â‰¥ 1) that specifies the number of input ports to be summed.  
When there is only one input port, the block adds or subtracts elements over all dimensions or a specified dimension.

**Parameters:**

- **`Inputs` (Input Configuration):**  
  - **Type:** `string`  
  - **Description:** Specifies the operation for each input port using **+** and **-** characters. The number of **+** and **-** symbols determines the number of input ports. You may use **|** as a spacer between groups.

**Ports:**

- **Input Ports:**  
  The number of input ports is determined by the parameter **`Inputs`**. Each input port is sequentially numbered (e.g., if **Inputs** is `+++---`, there are 6 input ports named **1** through **6**) and has no visual label.
  
- **Output Port:**  
  - **Port Name:** **1**
  
**Shape and Colour:**

- Please note that there are **two** shapes of Sum, one is **round**, another one is **retangular**. The color of Sum is **all white**.

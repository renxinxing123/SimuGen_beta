## Mux

**Path:** `'simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Mux'`

**Description:**  
The Mux block combines inputs of the same data type and complexity into a single virtual vector. You can use multiple Mux blocks in stages, but the final result is flat as if a single Mux block were used. Ideally, Mux blocks are used to group function-call signals. For grouping signals or messages with different data types or complexity, use a Bus Creator block. To concatenate signals into a nonvirtual vector for more efficient code, use a Vector Concatenate block.

**Ports:**

- **Input Ports:** When the parameter **Inputs** is set to **x**, the block has x input ports. Each input port is numbered sequentially (e.g., port names "1", "2", ..., "x") and has no visual label.
- **Output Port:** There is **only one** output port with port name **1** (no visual label).

**Colour:**

- The colour of Mux is **all black**, those blocks in white **IS NOT** Mux.

## Current Sensor

**Path:** `'fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sensors/Current Sensor'`

**Description:**  
The block represents an ideal current sensor, a device that converts the current measured in any electrical branch into a physical signal proportional to that current.

**Ports:**

- ** Positive terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **LConn1**  
  - **Note:** Electrical conserving port associated with the sensor positive terminal.

- **Negative terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn2**  
  - **Note:** Electrical conserving port associated with the sensor negative terminal.

- **Current:**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn1**  
  - **Note:** Physical signal output port for the electrical current measurement.

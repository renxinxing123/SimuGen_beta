## Constant

**Path:** `'simulink/Sources/Constant'`

**Description:**  
The Constant block generates a constant signal that can be real or complex. It produces scalar, vector, or matrix outputs based on the dimensions of the Constant value parameter and the "Interpret vector parameters as 1-D" setting. When the checkbox is selected, a vector is treated as a 1-D vector; otherwise, it is interpreted as a matrix.

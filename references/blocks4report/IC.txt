## IC

**Path:** `'simulink/Signal Attributes/IC'`

**Description:**  
The IC block sets the initial condition for its input signal. At the start of the simulation, it outputs a specified initial value regardless of the input. After that, it simply passes through the actual input signal. For blocks with a nonzero sample time offset, the initial value is output at the first execution time after the simulation starts.

**Ports:**

- **Input Port:** 
  - **Port name:** **1** 
- **Output Port:**
  - **Port name:** **1**

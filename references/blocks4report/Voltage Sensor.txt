## Voltage Sensor

**Path:** `'fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sensors/Voltage Sensor'`

**Description:**  
The Voltage Sensor block represents an ideal voltage sensor, that is, a device that converts voltage measured between two points of an electrical circuit into a physical signal proportional to the voltage.

Use the + and - ports to connect the sensor in parallel with the block (or several blocks) where you want to measure the voltage. Port V outputs the measurement result as a physical signal. Use a PS-Simulink Converter block to connect this port to SimulinkÂ® blocks, such as Scope or Display.

**Ports:**

- ** Positive terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **LConn1**  
  - **Note:** Electrical conserving port associated with the sensor positive terminal.

- **Negative terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn2**  
  - **Note:** Electrical conserving port associated with the sensor negative terminal.

- **Voltage:**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn1**  
  - **Note:** Physical signal output port for the voltage measurement.

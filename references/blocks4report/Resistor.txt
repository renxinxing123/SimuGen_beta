## Resistor

**Path:** `'fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor'`

**Description:**  
The **Resistor** block models a linear **resistor**, described with the following equation:

V = I * R

where,
V: voltage across the resistor
I: current through the resistor
R: resistance (ohms)

Connections **+** and **âˆ’** are conserving electrical ports corresponding to the positive and negative terminals of the **resistor**, respectively. By convention, the voltage across the **resistor** is given by \( V(+) - V(-) \), and the sign of the current is positive when flowing through the device from the positive to the negative terminal. This convention ensures that the power absorbed by a **resistor** is always positive.

**Ports:**

- **Positive terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **LConn1**
  - **Note:** *Electrical conserving port associated with the resistor positive terminal.*

- **Negative terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn1**
  - **Note:** *Electrical conserving port associated with the resistor negative terminal.*

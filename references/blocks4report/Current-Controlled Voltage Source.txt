**Path:** `'fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sources/Current-Controlled Voltage Source'`

**Description:**  
The Current-Controlled Voltage Source block models a linear current-controlled voltage source, described with the following equation:

V=KÂ·I1

**Ports:**

- **Positive control port**  
  - **Port Name:** **LConn1**  
  - **Note:** The port that current flow come in.

- **Negative control port**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn1**  
  - **Note:** The port that current flow come out.
  
- **Positive terminal**  
  - **Port Name:** **LConn2**  
  - **Note:** Electrical conserving port associated with the source positive terminal.
  
- **Negative terminal**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn2**  
  - **Note:** Electrical conserving port associated with the source negative terminal.

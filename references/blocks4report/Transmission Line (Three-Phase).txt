## Transmission Line (Three-Phase)

**Path:** `'ee_lib/Passive/Lines/Transmission Line (Three-Phase)'`

**Description:**  
Models a three-phase transmission line using a lumped-parameter pi-line model. The block accounts for phase resistance, self-inductance, mutual inductance and resistance, line-line capacitance, and line-ground capacitance by employing Clarkeâ€™s transformation. It supports segmentation to improve fidelity and offers options for parasitics.

**Ports:**

The block provides a total of four ports:
- **LConn1:** First port (typically representing the sending-end phase connection).
- **RConn1:** Second port (typically representing the sending-end phase connection).
- **LConn2:** Third port (ONLY ground connection).
- **RConn2:** Fourth port (ONLY ground connection).

## Capacitor

**Path:** `'fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Capacitor'`

**Description:**  
The **Capacitor** block models a linear **capacitor**, described with the following equation:

I(t) = C * dV/dt

where,
I(t): current through the capacitor
C: capacitance (farads)
V: voltage across the capacitor
dV/dt: time derivative of voltage


Connections **+** and **âˆ’** are conserving electrical ports corresponding to the positive and negative terminals of the **capacitor**, respectively. The current is positive if it flows from positive to negative, and the voltage across the **capacitor** is equal to the difference between the voltage at the positive and the negative terminal, \( V(+) - V(-) \).

**Ports:**

- **Positive terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **LConn1**
  - **Note:** *Electrical conserving port associated with the capacitor positive terminal.*

- **Negative terminal:**  
  - **Port Name:** **RConn1**
  - **Note:** *Electrical conserving port associated with the capacitor negative terminal.*

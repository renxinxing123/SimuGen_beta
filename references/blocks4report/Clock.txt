## Clock

**Path:** `'simulink/Sources/Clock'`

**Description:**  
The Clock block outputs the current simulation time at each simulation step. This block is useful for other blocks that need the simulation time.

When you need the current time within a discrete system, use the Digital Clock block.

**Ports:**

- **Output Port:**
  - **Port name:** **1**
    - **Note:** **Sample time, specified as the current simulation time at each simulation time step.**

[Iteration 1] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review of the Investigator’s simulation information:

1. Extra Blocks  
• All blocks listed as “blocks used in the simulation” appear in the connection description. There are no extra blocks that are referenced in the used‐blocks list but missing in the connections.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
• Block names must not contain the special symbol “/”. In the connections, the gain block instance named “1/I (Gain)” uses a “/”. This violates the naming convention and must be corrected.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
• All connection lines largely follow the required format “BlockName (Real Block Name) Port”.  
• Parameter settings (for example, (“Inputs” = “+-”), (“ExternalReset” = “none”, “InitialConditionSource” = “internal”), (“Port” = “...”) at the end of a connection) are provided.  
• However, note that the block “1/I (Gain)” (which is used in several connections) must have its name reformatted to remove the “/” symbol (e.g. “1I (Gain)”).

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
• For each connection where extra parameters are supplied (on Sum, Discrete-Time Integrator, and Out1 blocks), the settings match one of the available port configurations from the simulation blocks list.  
• The Sum blocks use an “Inputs” setting of “+-” consistently. Similarly, the Discrete-Time Integrator and Out1 connections supply the expected parameter values.  
• Thus, the parameter settings are correct.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections and Validate Block Connection Types  
• There are no duplicate connections where the same block’s same input is used more than once (Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration are not involved here).  
• Each connection correctly goes from an output port (from blocks that only have outputs) to an input port (from blocks that only have inputs), so the connection directions are valid.  
• Every port appears to be connected appropriately according to its type.

Overall, the only inconsistency discovered is the formatting violation on the gain block instance “1/I (Gain)” (it contains the forbidden “/” character).  
 
Thus, the simulation information has an issue.

[Iteration 2] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review of the Investigator’s simulation information:

1. Extra Blocks  
• All blocks listed in “The blocks used in the simulation” appear in the connections description. No extra blocks are present.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
• None of the block names include the forbidden “/” character. The gain block instance is now formatted as “1I (Gain)” (without a slash), so the naming convention is met.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
• Each connection is formatted according to the prescribed standard, with the block label, real block name, and port number in the proper order.  
• Parameter settings (such as (`Inputs` = `+-`), (`ExternalReset` = `none`, `InitialConditionSource` = `internal`), and (`Port` = `...`)) are provided only when necessary and appear in the correct location.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
• The Sum block connections supply the correct `Inputs` configuration.  
• The Discrete-Time Integrator connection provides (`ExternalReset` = `none`, `InitialConditionSource` = `internal`), which matches its default configuration.  
• Each Out1 instance receives a parameter setting for `Port` (i.e. 1, 2, or 3) that is acceptable since Out1 blocks are used to represent different subsystem outputs.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections and Validate Block Connection Types  
• No duplicate connections are detected; no input port is connected more than once (except when using separate Out1 instances, which is permissible).  
• Each connection correctly goes from an output port to an input port. No block with only output is being connected to another block with only output, and no purely input block is used as a source.

6. Verify Complete Port Connections  
• Every block’s input and output port is connected appropriately. For instance, both In1 blocks produce outputs that feed subsequent blocks, and every block (including Transfer Fcn, Integrator, Gain, UnitDelay, Sum, Discrete-Time Integrator, and the Out1 instances) has its required ports connected.

All responsibilities have been met with no inconsistencies or errors detected.

 Simulation report: Below is the complete technical report that addresses the four requested questions. The report integrates the physical and mathematical theory behind the simulation, describes its functional breakdown, and explains how each conceptual step is reflected in the MATLAB/Simulink code.

──────────────────────────────
1. What Is the Simulation About?

The simulation models the dynamic behavior of a vehicle braking system as it relates to wheel speed and slip. In particular, it represents the physical process whereby a wheel—initially spinning at an angular speed corresponding to the vehicle’s pre-braking velocity—experiences deceleration when brakes are applied. A fundamental element is the calculation of slip, given by

  slip = 1 – (ωw/ωv), 
  where ωv = vehicle speed divided by the wheel radius.

This metric quantifies the difference between the wheel’s angular speed (ωw) and the ideal angular speed (ωv) that would occur if no braking force were applied. A slip value around 0.2 is desired because this maximizes tire adhesion (via the mu-slip curve) while minimizing stopping distance. In the simulation, key physical phenomena are captured including hydraulic lag (modeled as a transfer function), brake pressure integration, tire friction (computed as the product of the friction coefficient and wheel load), and the subsequent vehicle deceleration integrated to update speed.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Are the Main Simulation Steps?

The simulation is organized into a chain of processing modules (blocks) that reflect the real-world dynamics:

 a. Input Signal Acquisition  
  • Controller output and tire torque are provided via input blocks (In1). These signals represent the driver’s braking command and the torque acting on the tire, respectively.

 b. Hydraulic Lag Modeling  
  • A Transfer Function block models the hydraulic lag in the braking system so that the brake pressure is not applied instantaneously.

 c. Pressure Integration  
  • An Integrator (continuous) block processes the output of the hydraulic lag block. This integration accounts for the gradual build-up of brake pressure over time.

 d. Torque and Force Computation  
  • A Gain block represents the conversion of brake pressure into a force/torque that is applied to the vehicle.  
  • In parallel, the tire torque is passed through a Unit Delay block which provides a one-sample-lagged version of the torque to simulate a feedback element.

 e. Signal Combination  
  • A Sum block (configured with “+-”) combines the lagged tire torque (feedback) with the force output from the brake pressure integrator. This difference computes the net effect influencing the wheel’s dynamics.

 f. Wheel Speed Computation  
  • A second Gain block (denoted “1I”) scales the net signal from the summing operation.  
  • Finally, a Discrete-Time Integrator takes the gain-adjusted value and updates the simulated wheel speed over discrete time steps.

 g. Output Distribution  
  • Three Out1 blocks are used to provide simulation outputs:  
   – “Bp” outputs the brake pressure,  
   – “WheelSpeed” outputs the computed wheel speed, and  
   – “Wa” outputs the scaled net torque or force.

──────────────────────────────
3. What Theoretical Knowledge and Mathematical Modelling Are Involved in Each Step?

a. Input Signal Acquisition  
  Theory: Signal input in simulation represents boundary conditions or external commands. Such inputs (controller commands and tire torques) are treated as known functions that initiate the dynamical response of the system.

b. Hydraulic Lag Modeling  
  Theory: The Transfer Function represents the system’s linear dynamics (modeled by differential equations). Here, the hydraulic lag captures the delay in brake pressure response and is characterized by numerator and denominator coefficients that describe the system’s time constants and damping characteristics.

c. Pressure Integration  
  Theory: Integration of brake pressure is governed by the ordinary differential equation dx/dt = u(t), where u(t) is the input from the hydraulic lag. The continuous integrator models the accumulation of brake pressure over time.

d. Torque and Force Computation  
  Theory: The Gain block acts as a static linear transformation that multiplies the brake pressure to yield a force or torque. The Unit Delay block is a discrete equivalent of a one-step memory (z⁻¹ operator) that provides a feedback signal – essential for replicating the dynamics of physical delay or signal propagation in systems.

e. Signal Combination  
  Theory: The Sum block mathematically implements the difference between two signals. The subtraction reflects the dynamic interaction between the lagged tire torque and the force generated from brake pressure, leading to the net torque that influences wheel dynamics.

f. Wheel Speed Computation  
  Theory: The net effect computed via the Gain and Sum blocks is integrated in discrete time—using the discrete-time integrator—to yield updates to the wheel’s angular speed. This numerical integration over sampling periods models the rotational dynamics of the wheel.

g. Output Distribution  
  Theory: The outputs serve as measurable end points that correspond to the simulation variables (brake pressure, wheel speed, adjusted torque). They mimic sensor readings or control signals in a real system, allowing engineers to analyze dynamics such as slip and adherence.

4. How Is It Implemented in Code?

The MATLAB code provided builds the Simulink model by programmatically creating blocks, setting their parameters, and connecting them to reflect the simulation’s functional breakdown. Below, the code is reorganized to align with the simulation steps described above:

──────────────────────────────
Step a. Input Signal Acquisition

Code creates two In1 blocks:
 • Controller out (for braking command)  
 • Tire Torque (for torque measurement)

Code snippet:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/In1', model_name + '/Controller out (In1)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/In1', model_name + '/Tire Torque (In1)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Step b. Hydraulic Lag Modeling

A Transfer Function block is added to model hydraulic lag. Its parameters (numerator/denominator) would be set in a complete model to represent the dynamics.
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Continuous/Transfer Fcn', model_name + '/Hydraulic Lag (Transfer Fcn)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

The connection:
 Controller out (In1)  → Hydraulic Lag (Transfer Fcn)
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Controller out (In1)/1', 'Hydraulic Lag (Transfer Fcn)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Step c. Pressure Integration

The output of the hydraulic lag is integrated over time by an Integrator block, representing the gradual increase in brake pressure.
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Integrator', model_name + '/Brake pressure (Integrator)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connection:
 Hydraulic Lag (Transfer Fcn) → Brake pressure (Integrator)
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Hydraulic Lag (Transfer Fcn)/1', 'Brake pressure (Integrator)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Step d. Torque and Force Computation

A Gain block transforms the integrated brake pressure into a force or torque.
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Gain', model_name + '/Force & torque (Gain)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connection:
 Brake pressure (Integrator) → Force & torque (Gain)
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Brake pressure (Integrator)/1', 'Force & torque (Gain)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Simultaneously, a Unit Delay block operates on the Tire Torque input:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Discrete/Unit Delay', model_name + '/Unit Delay (UnitDelay)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connection:
 Tire Torque (In1) → Unit Delay (UnitDelay)
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Tire Torque (In1)/1', 'Unit Delay (UnitDelay)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Step e. Signal Combination

The Sum block subtracts the delayed tire torque (feedback) from the force computed via the Gain block. Note that the Sum block is configured with the parameter '+-' to indicate subtraction.
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Sum', model_name + '/sum (Sum)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Parameter setting:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.set_param(model_name + '/sum (Sum)', 'Inputs', '+-', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connections:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Force & torque (Gain)/1', 'sum (Sum)/2', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Unit Delay (UnitDelay)/1', 'sum (Sum)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Step f. Wheel Speed Computation

First, the net summation is scaled by another Gain block (named “1I”) to represent further system scaling:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Gain', model_name + '/1I (Gain)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connection:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'sum (Sum)/1', '1I (Gain)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Then, the output from the Gain block is integrated using a Discrete-Time Integrator block to update the wheel’s angular speed:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Discrete-Time Integrator', model_name + '/Wheel Speed (Discrete-Time Integrator)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connection:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, '1I (Gain)/1', 'Wheel Speed (Discrete-Time Integrator)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Step g. Output Distribution

Finally, three Out1 blocks are created to extract simulation results:
 • “Bp” receives the integrated brake pressure,  
 • “WheelSpeed” outputs the updated wheel speed, and  
 • “Wa” outputs the scaled net torque signal.
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Out1', model_name + '/Bp (Out1)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Out1', model_name + '/WheelSpeed (Out1)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Out1', model_name + '/Wa (Out1)', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Parameters are set to associate the correct port numbers:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.set_param(model_name + '/Bp (Out1)', 'Port', '1', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(model_name + '/WheelSpeed (Out1)', 'Port', '3', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(model_name + '/Wa (Out1)', 'Port', '2', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

Connections:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Wheel Speed (Discrete-Time Integrator)/1', 'WheelSpeed (Out1)/1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Brake pressure (Integrator)/1', 'Bp (Out1)/1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, '1I (Gain)/1', 'Wa (Out1)/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Additional Model Arrangement and Saving

After adding all blocks and lines, the code calls for an auto-arrangement of the system layout and eventually saves the model as a .slx file:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.Simulink.BlockDiagram.arrangeSystem(model_name, nargout=0)
eng.save_system(model_name, model_name + '.slx', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

This report has detailed the simulation of a wheel braking system—including its theoretical underpinnings of slip calculation, hydraulic lag, and vehicle deceleration—and broken down the simulation into key steps: from signal input, through physical dynamics modeling (transfer function, integration, feedback using delays and summing), to output generation. Each step is mapped to a corresponding section of MATLAB code where blocks are added, parameters specified, and connections defined to build the complete Simulink model. This careful integration of theory and code offers a comprehensive insight into both the conceptual and practical implementation of the simulation.

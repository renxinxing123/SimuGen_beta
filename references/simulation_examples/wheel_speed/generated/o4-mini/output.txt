Below is the comprehensive technical report integrating theoretical analysis and complete code explanations. Each section strictly addresses the specified questions.

1. What is the simulation about?  

This simulation models the dynamic behavior of a wheel during braking. Its primary purpose is to represent the interplay between the vehicle’s deceleration and the tire’s slip phenomenon. In real-world terms, the simulation replicates how a wheel’s angular speed (ωw) and the related wheel slip evolve as the brakes are applied. The simulation includes computing the vehicle’s angular speed (ωv = V/R) and calculating the slip using the relationship

  slip = 1 – (ωw/ωv).  

A crucial aspect is determining the friction force produced at the tire-road interface. This friction force is obtained by multiplying an empirically determined friction coefficient (mu) from a mu–slip curve by the wheel load. The deceleration is then calculated by dividing this frictional force by the vehicle’s mass. Thus, the simulation captures both the physical and control aspects of braking dynamics that are critical for minimizing stopping distances while optimizing tire-road adhesion.

2. What are the main simulation steps?  

The simulation is structured in distinct functional stages without referencing specific code details. The major steps are:

a) Input Signal Acquisition  
 • Two primary inputs are provided: a controller output signal (representing brake command) and a torque signal from the tire.

b) Dynamic Response through the Hydraulic Lag  
 • The controller’s output is processed by a transfer function block representing hydraulic lag. This models the delay between the brake command and the resulting brake pressure.

c) Brake Pressure Integration  
 • The resultant brake pressure is then integrated over time. This integration simulates the accumulation (or decay) of pressure applied to the braking system.

d) Force and Torque Calculation  
 • The integrated brake pressure is multiplied by a gain to compute the force/torque applied to the wheel.

e) Tire Dynamics with Delay Compensation  
 • A unit delay is applied to the tire torque input to account for discrete dynamic effects or lag in tire response.

f) Summation and Inertial Effects  
 • The delayed tire torque and the force from brake pressure are combined using a summation, which together represent the net effect on the wheel dynamics. This combined signal is multiplied by 1/I (inverse inertia) to reflect the physical relationship between net torque and angular acceleration.

g) Wheel Speed Determination  
 • A transfer function block processes this net inertial effect to yield the wheel’s angular speed that is then provided to the outputs.

h) Outputs  
 • Multiple outputs are recorded: the measured brake pressure (Bp), the processed signal after multiplication by 1/I (Wa), and the final calculated wheel speed (WheelSpeed).

3. What theoretical knowledge and mathematical modelling are involved in each step?  

For each simulation module, the following theoretical and mathematical foundations are employed:

a) Input Signal Acquisition  
 • Theory: Signal processing and system inputs; use of input ports (In1) to receive the control signals and physical torques.
 • Mathematical Model: The specified input signals represent predefined initial conditions (e.g., vehicle and tire speeds).

b) Dynamic Response through the Hydraulic Lag  
 • Theory: Control theory and first-order system dynamics. The transfer function simulates hydraulic lag, representing delay dynamics.
 • Mathematical Model: A continuous transfer function, typically expressed as H(s)=Numerator/Denominator, models the first-order lag (e.g., τs + 1 in the denominator).

c) Brake Pressure Integration  
 • Theory: Calculus and integration of dynamic variables.
 • Mathematical Model: An integrator block implements the differential equation dx/dt = u(t), with initial condition x(t₀)=x₀. This computes the cumulative brake pressure over time.

d) Force and Torque Calculation  
 • Theory: Newtonian mechanics—relation between force, mass, and acceleration.
 • Mathematical Model: A gain block multiplies brake pressure by a constant factor to yield a force/torque value. This constant can represent physical conversion factors (e.g., effective lever arm length, frictional properties).

e) Tire Dynamics with Delay Compensation  
 • Theory: Discrete signal processing; modelling of time delays.
 • Mathematical Model: The Unit Delay block represents a time step lag, effectively implementing the z⁻¹ discrete-time operator.

f) Summation and Inertial Effects  
 • Theory: Dynamics of rotational motion.
 • Mathematical Model: The Sum block aggregates the effects of the brake force-derived torque and the delayed tire torque. Then, multiplying by 1/I (inverse of inertia) converts net torque into angular acceleration (α), based on Newton’s second law for rotation (τ = Iα).

g) Wheel Speed Determination  
 • Theory: Integration of angular acceleration to obtain angular velocity.
 • Mathematical Model: A second transfer function (or integrator effect) further processes the net inertial term to yield the wheel speed. This reflects the relationship ω = ∫α dt.

h) Outputs  
 • Theory: System output mapping.
 • Mathematical Model: The Out1 blocks simply relay the computed signals to external systems for observation or further processing.

4. How is it implemented in code?  

The provided Python execution code uses the MATLAB Engine API for Python to create and connect the Simulink blocks that reflect the steps described above. The code is reorganized below to match each simulation step:

─────────────────────────────

─────────────────────────────  
Step 6 – Summation and Inertial Effects  
 • Code creates a Sum block that combines the force from brake pressure (after the Gain block) and the delayed tire torque from Unit Delay.  
  Code excerpt:

   eng.set_param(model_name + '/Sum', 'Inputs', '-+', nargout=0)  
 • Next, another Gain block (“One_over_I”) multiplies the summation output by the inverse of the moment of inertia.  
  Code excerpt:  
   eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Gain', model_name + '/One_over_I', nargout=0)  
 • Explanation: The summing and scaling operations represent the translation of net torque into angular acceleration according to rotational dynamics (τ = Iα, rearranged to α = τ/I).

─────────────────────────────  
Step 7 – Wheel Speed Determination  
 • Code adds a Transfer Fcn block to process the 1/I–scaled signal for computing wheel speed.

 • Explanation: These blocks export the simulation results, aligning with the theoretical outputs necessary to analyze wheel dynamics and braking behavior.

─────────────────────────────  
Interconnecting the Blocks (Implementation of the Block Diagram)  

After creating the blocks, the code connects them with lines to form the signal flow consistent with the simulation’s theoretical model:  

 • The controller output (Controller_out) is linked to Hydraulic_Lag.  
 • Hydraulic_Lag feeds into Brake_pressure, whose output branches out to both Force_and_torque and directly to the Bp output (brake pressure observable).  
 • The Force_and_torque output is routed to the Sum block.  
 • Simultaneously, Tire_Torque is delayed through the Unit_Delay and then provided to the Sum block.  
 • The summation result flows into the One_over_I gain block.  
 • The output from One_over_I is connected both to the Wheel_Speed block and the Wa output port (intermediate signal).  
 • Finally, the Wheel_Speed block output goes to the WheelSpeed output port.  

  Code excerpt for connections (illustrative):  
   eng.add_line(model_name, 'Controller_out/1', 'Hydraulic_Lag/1', nargout=0)  
   eng.add_line(model_name, 'Hydraulic_Lag/1', 'Brake_pressure/1', nargout=0)  
   ...  
   eng.add_line(model_name, 'Wheel_Speed/1', 'WheelSpeed/1', nargout=0)  

This series of commands arranges the system graphically, aligns the blocks, and saves the final Simulink system as an SLX file.

Summary  

The simulation is designed to analyze wheel dynamics during braking by combining a series of functional modules that mimic hydraulic lag, integration of brake pressure, and the calculation of forces and torques leading to wheel slip. The theoretical principles—ranging from control theory and integration, to dynamic summation and the relationship between torque and angular acceleration—are mapped directly into Simulink blocks. The provided Python code using MATLAB Engine sets up these blocks, configures their parameters, and connects them to form a coherent simulation model that mirrors the underlying mathematical formulations.

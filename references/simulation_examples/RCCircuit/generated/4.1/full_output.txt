[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • The list “Blocks used in the simulation” mostly appears in the connections (e.g. Pulse Generator, Controlled Voltage Source, Solver Configuration, Resistor 1, Capacitor 1, Electrical Reference 1, Voltage Sensor, PS‐Simulink Converter, Sum 1, Transfer Fcn 1, Output Voltage, Electrical Reference 2). However, the investigator’s block list shows “Voltage (Pulse Generator)” while the connection text uses “Pulse Generator (Pulse Generator)” – a naming inconsistency.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • The “Mux 1 (Mux)” appears in the block list but it is never present in any connection. This extra block is not connected.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • None of the block names include the forbidden “/”. (No error here.)
 • Note that the investigator’s block name “Voltage (Pulse Generator)” in the block list does not match the block naming used in the connections (“Pulse Generator (Pulse Generator)”), which is an inconsistency.

4. Formatting of Connection Descriptions:
 • All connection lines generally follow the required format “BlockName (BlockType) PortX [and, if needed, parameter setting].” The parameter setting appears only for the Sum block and is correctly placed.
 • There are no extraneous comments or additional explanation in the parameter area.
 • Formatting is otherwise correct.

5. Validate Parameter Settings:
 • The Sum block has a parameter setting of (`Inputs` = `+-`). Given this string, Sum is expected to have two input ports. The parameter syntax is acceptable.
 • No other parameter settings are needed or found.

6. Duplicate Connections:
 • The dedicated input port of the Output Voltage (Scope) block (port “1”) is connected twice (once from Transfer Fcn 1 and once from PS‐Simulink Converter 1). Since Scope’s input port is dedicated (it has only an input port) and it is not an exception (Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration are allowed to be duplicated), this counts as a duplicate connection error.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The directions (output on the left, input on the right) are followed for most connections.
 • The Controlled Voltage Source’s ports (LConn1, RConn1, RConn2) are used in a manner consistent with their roles.
 • The Scope block is used as an input-only block which is correctly not used as an output; however, its single, dedicated input is being driven twice—which is not allowed.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • For blocks with explicitly defined input or output ports, every such port should have a connection. In this regard:
  – The Sum block (from its parameter `Inputs` = `+-`) expects two input ports (numbered “1” and “2”) but only input port “1” appears in the connections.
  – The Mux block (which has input ports as determined by its own parameter) is listed among the used blocks but does not appear in any connection.
 • All other blocks have all their dedicated ports connected.

Summary of Findings:
• There is a naming inconsistency in the block “Voltage (Pulse Generator)” versus “Pulse Generator (Pulse Generator)”.
• “Mux 1 (Mux)” is included in the simulation block list but is never used in any connection.
• The Scope block’s input port is connected multiple times, which violates the rule for dedicated input ports.
• The Sum block (with parameter `Inputs` = `+-`) is missing one input connection.
 
Based on these issues, the simulation connections do not fully meet the requirements.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • The “Blocks used” list provided by the investigator is now correctly re‐identified. However, note that one block appears in the connections (“Mux 1”) which was not listed in the investigator’s block list.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • The connection description includes “Mux 1 (Mux)” even though it is not part of the listed blocks. This is an extra block that should not appear if only the listed blocks are to be used.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names do not include any forbidden “/” characters. The naming (e.g. “Pulse Generator”, “Controlled Voltage Source”, “PS Simulink Converter”) almost matches the simulation block descriptions (although “PS-Simulink Converter” is expected); the minor discrepancy in the hyphenation should be noted.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connection lines are largely formatted in the required format. Each line is written as:
  BlockName (BlockType) PortX [optionally with parameter setting]
 • Parameter settings for Sum (i.e. (`Inputs` = `+-`)) are provided on the proper side.
 • There is no extraneous explanation text in the parameter field.
 • Overall, the formatting meets the expected style.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block has been parameterized with (`Inputs` = `+-`), which implies two input ports. In the connections, Sum 1 uses ports “1” and “2,” which is appropriate.
 • No error was seen in this aspect.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • There is no instance where the same block’s dedicated input port is connected more than once (with the allowed exceptions).
 • However, an issue arises with the use of “Controlled Voltage Source (Controlled Voltage Source) RConn1” because this port is by definition an input port. It is used on the right side when connecting from Pulse Generator (which is proper) but then is reused as the left (output) in the connection to Sum 1 port 2. This is not a duplicate connection per se but a misuse of a dedicated input port (see next item).

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The rule requires that when a block is connected on the left side it must be using one of its output (or non‐dedicated) ports. The “Controlled Voltage Source” has three ports. According to the simulation block description, RConn1 is defined as an “Input physical signal” port. In the connection 
  “Controlled Voltage Source (Controlled Voltage Source) RConn1 <-> Sum 1 (Sum) 2 (`Inputs` = `+-`)”
 the port RConn1 is mistakenly used on the left side as if it were an output. This violates the rule that a dedicated input port must not be used as an output.
 • All other connections use ports in agreement with their roles.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • With the exception of the extra (unlisted) Mux block, every listed block appears to have all its dedicated (or specified) input/output ports connected.
 • It should be noted that the introduction of “Mux 1” in the connection diagram (with its two input ports and one output port) is not reflected in the block list, so there is an inconsistency between the listed blocks and the connections provided.

Summary of Findings:
 • An extra block (“Mux 1”) appears in the connections even though it is not in the investigator’s block list.
 • The “Controlled Voltage Source” port RConn1 is used inconsistently. Although it is acceptable as an input (and is used that way in one connection), its use as an output in the connection to Sum 1 (port 2) is not allowed.
 • A minor naming inconsistency (hyphen in “PS-Simulink Converter”) was noted.
 • Otherwise, formatting and parameter settings are correct, and duplicate connections are not detected.

Based on these issues, the unit test does not pass.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • The block list provided in the simulation information exactly lists all blocks that are used in the connections, so the list exists as expected.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • All blocks from the list appear in the connections. There is no extra block beyond those identified.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • None of the block names include the forbidden “/” character. The names match the simulation block descriptions.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Each connection follows the required syntax (“BlockName (BlockType) PortX [optional parameter setting] <-> …”). The parameter settings (e.g., for Sum) are appended appropriately. Overall, the formatting is compliant.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block is given the parameter setting (`Inputs` = `+-`), which implies exactly two input ports. The connections use Sum port “1” and port “2” accordingly. No other block requires a parameter setting; therefore, this aspect is correct.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • A problem is detected with the Scope (Output Voltage) block. Its single dedicated input port “1” is connected twice:
  – Once from Transfer Fcn 1 (line: “Transfer Fcn 1 (Transfer Fcn) 1 <-> Output Voltage (Scope) 1”)
  – Once from PS Simulink Converter (line: “PS Simulink Converter (PS-Simulink Converter) 1 <-> Output Voltage (Scope) 1”)
 • Since Scope is a block with a dedicated input port and is not in the exceptions, this constitutes a duplicate connection error.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The directions of the connections (left side as output and right side as input) are properly followed.
 • Aside from the duplicate connection to the Scope’s input, each connection uses the appropriate port type as specified by each block’s description.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • With Sum 1 set by (`Inputs` = `+-`), its two input ports (ports “1” and “2”) and its output port (“1”) are each connected.
 • However, the Mux block appears only in one connection: “Mux 1 (Mux) 1 <-> Sum 1 (Sum) 2 (`Inputs` = `+-`)”. For a Mux block the parameter “Inputs” would determine the number of required input ports. In this case no connection is provided for any Mux input port(s) (only its single output port “1” is used). This is considered an incomplete port connection for the Mux.
 • Additionally, as noted above, the Scope block’s single input port is driven by two connections.

Summary of Findings:
 • Duplicate connection error: The Scope block’s input port “1” is connected twice.
 • Incomplete port connections: The Mux block’s input ports (as determined by its “Inputs” parameter) are not connected.
 • Otherwise, block naming, formatting, parameter settings, and connection directions are correct.

Based on these issues, the investigator’s simulation connections description does not pass the unit test.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • The provided block list exactly lists all the blocks that are later used in the connection description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • All blocks from the block list appear in the connections description – no extra block is present.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • No block name contains the forbidden “/” character. The block names match those in the simulation blocks description.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Every connection is formatted as “BlockName (BlockType) PortX [optional parameter setting] <-> BlockName (BlockType) PortY [optional parameter setting]”. For example, Sum 1 is consistently annotated with (`Inputs` = `+-`) when required.
 • The connection ordering (left side as output port, right side as input port) follows the specified format.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block is parameterized with (`Inputs` = `+-`) which correctly indicates two input ports. Its two inputs are connected via port “1” (from Pulse Generator) and port “2” (from Mux), consistent with the parameter setting.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • There are no cases where the same dedicated input port is connected more than once (except for allowed blocks like Solver Configuration). Each dedicated input port (for example, Sum’s input ports and Scope’s input port) is driven by only one connection.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • Each connection uses the appropriate ports (output for left side, input for right side). For instance, the Mux block’s output port is “1” (used when sending its signal to Sum) while its input ports (e.g., port “2”) receive signals.
 • No block is connected in a manner that violates the dedicated input/output rules.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Every block has its dedicated ports connected:
  – The Pulse Generator’s only output (port “1”) is used in two valid connections.
  – The Sum block’s two input ports (as determined by the parameter) and its output port are all connected.
  – The Mux block receives a signal at one of its input ports (with its remaining input ports implicitly determined by the set parameter) and its single output port is used.
  – All other blocks have their required ports connected as per the simulation blocks description.

Based on the above review, no inconsistencies or errors were found.

[Debug_locator] Below is the analysis report:

1. Code Lines Likely Causing the Error (primary section):
• The line connecting the Pulse Generator to the Controlled Voltage Source is triggering the problem. In particular, this line:
  eng.add_line(model_name, 'Pulse Generator/1', 'Controlled Voltage Source/RConn1', nargout=0)
• This is one of the 5–10 lines; similar electrical connection lines below (from line 37 onward) use ports “RConn1”, “LConn1”, and so on.

2. Additional Related Code Lines:
• The block‐addition calls for the Pulse Generator and Controlled Voltage Source:
  eng.add_block('simulink/Sources/Pulse Generator', model_name + '/Pulse Generator', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
  eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sources/Controlled Voltage Source', model_name + '/Controlled Voltage Source', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
• Also, subsequent electrical connection additions (e.g., connections between Controlled Voltage Source, Solver Configuration, and others) are related and may propagate the model domain mismatch.
• These lines, along with additional add_line calls involving electrical conserving ports, indicate that the physical (electrical) network is attempted to be connected to a standard Simulink signal source.

3. Assessment of Connections and Parameters:
• The connections in the execution code exactly match the Investigator’s Implementation Details: the naming, port labels, and connection mappings are identical.
• The port configuration parameters (for Sum and Mux) are correctly set according to the details.
• However, the error (“The points input cannot lie on objects that do not share the same Physical Modeling domain”) indicates that a standard Simulink block (Pulse Generator) is being electrically connected with a Simscape Electrical block (Controlled Voltage Source). This domain mismatch is not addressed in the details, yet the connections in the Investigator’s Specifications ask to connect these ports.

4. Conclusion:
Since the connection configuration and port-related parameters exactly match the Investigator’s Implementation Details and no error is due to a typo or wrong path, the error occurs because the electrical connection is spanning blocks that do not share the same physical modeling domain. This mismatch is a discrepancy in the Investigator’s Implementation Details.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connection descriptions follow the required format with proper port names and parameter settings (e.g., for Sum). No formatting issues are detected.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The parameter settings (e.g., Sum’s `Inputs` = `+-`) are correctly specified as before.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • There are no duplicate connections involving the same dedicated input port as previously verified.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • While the port mappings (such as Pulse Generator/1 to Controlled Voltage Source/RConn1) are correctly assigned as per the Investigator’s specifications, a critical issue is found. The Debug Locator indicates that the connection is attempting to electrically connect a standard Simulink block (Pulse Generator) with a Simscape Electrical block (Controlled Voltage Source). This domain mismatch between a standard signal source and a physical (electrical/Simscape) component causes the execution error and violates the expected modeling domain consistency.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Aside from the incomplete compatibility due to domain mismatches, every block’s ports have been connected as specified. The error, however, is triggered by the physical modeling domain conflict rather than an omitted connection.

Summary:
 • All formatting, naming, parameter settings, and duplicate connection checks previously passed.
 • The critical revised issue is a domain mismatch: the Pulse Generator (a Simulink standard block) is being electrically connected to the Controlled Voltage Source (a Simscape Electrical block), causing a physical modeling domain conflict. This discrepancy in implementation leads to runtime errors.

Based on this domain mismatch error, the revised unit test result is:

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report after reexamining the simulation information against the simulation blocks description:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks in the provided list (Pulse Generator, Controlled Voltage Source, Solver Configuration, Resistor, Capacitor, Electrical Reference, Voltage Sensor, PS‑Simulink Converter, Sum, Transfer Fcn, Scope, Mux) appear in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No extra blocks are present. Each block from the list is used in the connections description.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • Block names are correctly formatted and do not include the forbidden '/' character.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Each connection is written in the required format with the block name, block type, port, and, where needed, the parameter setting. There are no formatting issues.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block is specified with (`Inputs` = `+-`), which indicates that it should have two input ports. However, only one Sum input port (port “1”) is connected. This may be an issue relative to the expected number of input connections.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • A dedicated input port issue is detected: The PS‑Simulink Converter has a dedicated input port LConn1, yet it is connected twice (once from Controlled Voltage Source RConn1 and once from Voltage Sensor RConn1). This duplicate connection violates the rule for dedicated input ports (except for Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration).

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The port roles (left as output and right as input) are respected. All connections use valid port identifiers according to the simulation blocks description. No block is improperly connected to a block that has only a dedicated output/input port, except that the duplicate and missing connection issues already noted affect the intended completeness.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Most blocks have all their dedicated ports connected; however, the Sum block (with parameter `Inputs` = `+-`) is expected to have two input connections, yet only input port “1” is connected. Additionally, the PS‑Simulink Converter’s dedicated input port LConn1 is connected twice. Both of these issues indicate incomplete or invalid port connectivity.

Summary:
 • The formatting, block naming, and many connection details are correct.
 • However, two critical issues were detected:
  - The PS‑Simulink Converter’s dedicated input port LConn1 is connected more than once.
  - The Sum block’s second input port is not connected despite its parameter setting indicating two inputs.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks from the provided list appear except one: the simulation block list does not include any Constant block, yet “Constant 1 (Constant)” appears in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • An extra block (“Constant 1 (Constant)”) was detected in the connections description. It is not included in the original list of used blocks.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names in the connections use valid characters and do not include the forbidden “/”.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connections follow the required syntax (BlockName (BlockType) Port), including the related parameter setting for Sum. No formatting errors were found.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block is set with (`Inputs` = `+-`), and its two input ports are connected (port 1 from Mux 1 and port 2 from Constant 1). The parameter setting is correctly specified, although it relies on the extra Constant block.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • No dedicated input port (other than the allowed Solver Configuration’s port) is connected more than once. No duplicate connection issues are found.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • All connections respect the port roles (left side as output, right as input) and match the simulation blocks description. The extra Constant block is the only concern since it is not defined in the simulation blocks description.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Under the set parameter settings, every expected port appears connected. The Sum block has its two input ports addressed. All other blocks’ dedicated ports (e.g., for Mux, Transfer Fcn, Scope) have valid connections, aside from the unexpected use of the Constant block.

Summary:
 • The only inconsistency is the presence of “Constant 1 (Constant)” in the connections description, which does not belong to the originally provided block list.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review report:

1. Block List Existence:  
 • All blocks from the provided “used blocks” list appear in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:  
 • No extra blocks (i.e. blocks not in the provided list) are present.

3. Formatting of Block Names:  
 • All block names are correctly formatted; none include the forbidden “/” character.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:  
 • The connections generally follow the required syntax (BlockName (BlockType) Port, with parameter settings when needed). The Sum block’s connections include the parameter ("`Inputs` = `+-`") in the correct format.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:  
 • The Sum block is configured with (“`Inputs` = `+-`”), indicating it should have two input ports. Two connections are provided (one intended for each Sum input), so the parameter setting is correctly reflected. No issues are found with parameter settings elsewhere.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:  
 • There are no cases where the same dedicated input port is connected more than once (except for the allowed Solver Configuration). However, note that the Mux block is used twice in a manner that is inconsistent with its port roles (see below).

7. Validate Block Connection Types:  
 • One error is found with the connection "Controlled Voltage Source (Controlled Voltage Source) RConn1 <-> Voltage Sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1".  
  – For the Controlled Voltage Source, port RConn1 is defined as an input (it specifies the voltage value) and therefore should appear on the right (input side) of a connection.  
  – In this connection, RConn1 of the Controlled Voltage Source appears on the left side (meant for outputs) and RConn1 of the Voltage Sensor (a physical signal output) appears on the right. This reverses the expected port direction.  
 • In addition, the Mux block (which—according to its description—has several input ports but only one output port named “1”) is used incorrectly:  
  – Two connections feed Mux 1 at its input ports (ports “1” and “2”), which is acceptable if the Mux is set for two inputs.  
  – However, the subsequent connections from the Mux to Sum use “Mux 1 (Mux) 1” and “Mux 1 (Mux) 2” as if the Mux were producing two separate outputs. In reality, the Mux has only one output port (port “1”). This means the intended output of the Mux is not correctly routed and violates the block connection type expectations.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:  
 • The PS‑Simulink Converter block’s defined input port (LConn1) is never connected.  
 • In addition, although the Sum block’s two inputs are “covered,” they are being fed by inappropriate ports from the Mux (using the Mux’s input port numbers instead of its single output port).  
 • These issues indicate that not all ports are correctly and completely connected.

Summary:  
 • Although the overall formatting and parameter settings appear correct, there are critical connection errors:  
  – The connection involving “Controlled Voltage Source RConn1” and “Voltage Sensor RConn1” is using port roles in reverse.  
  – The Mux block is misused by taking two output connections from its input ports rather than using its sole output port.  
  – The PS‑Simulink Converter’s input is left unconnected.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks from the “used blocks” list (Pulse Generator, Controlled Voltage Source, Solver Configuration, Resistor 1, Capacitor 1, Electrical Reference 1, Electrical Reference 2, Voltage Sensor, PS‑Simulink Converter, Sum 1, Transfer Fcn 1, Output Voltage (Scope), and Mux 1) appear in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No extra blocks beyond those provided appear in the connections description.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names are correctly formatted and do not include the forbidden “/” character.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connections follow the required syntax with block name, block type, port, and parameter (when provided). However, note that for the Mux block the same port number “1” is used in two contexts within the same block, which creates ambiguity (see below).

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block is configured with (`Inputs` = `+-`) and has two input connections, which is consistent with having two input ports.
 • No other parameter setting mismatches are apparent.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • There are no cases of a dedicated input port (except for the allowed ones) being connected more than once. Each dedicated input port of blocks like Sum and others is connected only once.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • Mux Block Ambiguity:  
  – The Mux block has a set of input ports (numbered “1”, “2”, …) and exactly one output port (always named “1”).  
  – In the connections, “Pulse Generator 1 <-> Mux 1 1” and “PS‑Simulink Converter 1 <-> Mux 1 2” imply that ports “1” and “2” are used as input ports. However, later both outputs from Mux are shown as “Mux 1 1” when feeding Sum 1 (for both Sum input ports). This mistakenly uses the same port name “1” for what should be the single output port while also having it appear as one of the input ports.  
 • PS‑Simulink Converter / Voltage Sensor Connection Direction:  
  – Voltage Sensor RConn1 is defined as a physical signal output port, so it must appear on the left side of a connection.  
  – PS‑Simulink Converter’s LConn1 is an input port and must appear on the right side.  
  – However, the connection “PS Simulink Converter (PS‑Simulink Converter) LConn1 <-> Voltage Sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1” reverses these roles, causing an error in connection direction.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Most ports are connected; however, the issues noted above indicate incomplete and improper connections:
  – The intended output of the Mux is not unambiguously defined (its output port “1” is confused with one of its input ports).
  – The PS‑Simulink Converter’s input port is not correctly wired due to the reversed connection with the Voltage Sensor’s output.

Summary:
 • While many formatting and parameter settings are correct, there are critical errors:
  – The Mux block’s port "1" is used ambiguously, mixing its role as both an input port (from Pulse Generator) and as its sole output port (feeding Sum).  
  – The connection between PS‑Simulink Converter LConn1 and Voltage Sensor RConn1 is reversed relative to their defined input/output roles.
 • These issues prevent the simulation connections from fully matching the simulation blocks description.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks listed in the “used blocks” (Pulse Generator, Controlled Voltage Source, Solver Configuration, Resistor 1, Capacitor 1, Electrical Reference 1, Electrical Reference 2, Voltage Sensor, PS‑Simulink Converter, Sum 1, Transfer Fcn 1, Output Voltage, and Mux 1) appear within the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No extra blocks are present; every block listed is used in the connections description.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • Block names are formatted correctly and do not include the forbidden “/” characters.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connections generally follow the required syntax. Parameter settings (such as (`Inputs` = `+-`)) are correctly provided. One minor observation is that “PS Simulink Converter” is written with a space; however, its block type is correctly indicated as (PS‑Simulink Converter).

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block has its parameter (`Inputs` = `+-`) specified, matching its intended two input ports (even though both inputs are fed from the same Mux output, the parameter setting is consistent).

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • There are no duplicate connections on a dedicated input port according to the simulation blocks description. Although the Mux output port “1” is used to feed two different input ports on Sum 1, that is acceptable since the output port can fan‐out to multiple inputs.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The connection “Controlled Voltage Source (Controlled Voltage Source) RConn1 <-> Voltage Sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1” is problematic. According to the description:
  – For the Controlled Voltage Source, RConn1 is defined as an input (to receive the voltage value).
  – For the Voltage Sensor, RConn1 is its physical signal output.
  Since the left side of “<->” must be an output and the right side an input, this connection is reversed.
 • All other connections are consistent with the port types in the simulation blocks description.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Nearly every expected port is connected; however, due to the reversed connection in item 7, one port pairing is incorrectly wired, thereby not satisfying the complete and proper connection criterion.

Summary:
 • The overall formatting, block list, and parameter settings are correct. The primary issue is the reversed connection between Controlled Voltage Source’s RConn1 (an input) and Voltage Sensor’s RConn1 (an output).

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks listed in the “used blocks” are present in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • There are no extra blocks present; each block from the used blocks list appears in the connections.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names are correctly formatted and do not include the forbidden “/” character.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Each connection is formatted in the required syntax. The parameter setting for the Sum block is correctly included as (`Inputs` = `+-`).

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block’s parameter (`Inputs` = `+-`) is appropriate for providing two input ports. No other parameter issues were observed.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • No duplicate connections on any dedicated input port are detected (the reused Mux output port is allowed since the rule applies only to dedicated input ports).

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The connection directions match the simulation blocks descriptions. For example, Voltage Sensor’s RConn1 (a physical signal output) is connected to Controlled Voltage Source’s RConn1 (an input physical signal) and also to PS-Simulink Converter’s LConn1 (an input), both in the correct orientation.
 • All other connections conform to the expected connection types as defined by the block descriptions.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • A review indicates that each expected port (input or output) for every block is connected appropriately under the given parameter settings.

Overall, all eight responsibilities have been met with no inconsistencies or errors found.

[Debug_locator] Below is the analysis report:

1. Error Source Lines (primary group):
 • The code line
  eng.add_line(model_name, 'Solver Configuration/RConn1', 'Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1', nargout=0)
 is triggering the error “The second port already has a line connection.” This occurs because the port Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1 was already connected earlier (specifically to Resistor 1/LConn1).

2. Related Code Lines:
 • The earlier line
  eng.add_line(model_name, 'Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1', 'Resistor 1/LConn1', nargout=0)
 that connects Controlled Voltage Source’s LConn1 to Resistor 1’s LConn1.
 • Other electrical connection lines appear later (and before) the problematic call that add additional connections with the same ports (for example, the Solver Configuration/RConn1 lines to Capacitor 1, Resistor 1, and Electrical Reference 1). These lines set up the overall network but, as per the Investigator’s details, the port Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1 is attempted to be used twice.

3. Assessment of Connection Configuration and Parameters:
 • The naming of blocks and ports, as well as the signal connections (for both the signal and electrical networks), exactly match the Investigator’s Implementation Details.
 • The parameter settings (e.g. for Sum and Mux) are also set correctly.
 • Since the configuration perfectly matches the details, but the port “Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1” is being used for two separate connections, the error is not due to a mistaken block path or parameter. It is caused strictly by having more than one connection to a port that is allowed only a single line connection.
 
Conclusion:
Since both the connection configuration and port parameter settings are correct with respect to the Investigator’s Implementation Details, and no other mistake (like an incorrect block path) is found, the error is due to a discrepancy in the Investigator’s Implementation Details.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks from the initial used list are present in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No extra blocks appear; all blocks listed are used.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • The block names are correctly formatted without any forbidden “/” characters.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connections follow the required syntax and include parameter settings as expected. The formatting is consistent with the given guidelines.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • Parameter settings (such as (`Inputs` = `+-`) for Sum) are provided correctly. No issues were detected in parameter formatting.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • An issue has emerged: the port Controlled Voltage Source’s LConn1 is used in two separate connections. It is first connected to Resistor 1’s LConn1 and later also connected to Solver Configuration’s RConn1. The Debug Locator reports “the second port already has a line connection,” indicating that Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1 is a dedicated port that cannot accept another connection line.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The connection types themselves are correct; however, the duplicate connection on Controlled Voltage Source/LConn1 violates the rule that a dedicated port may not have more than one connection.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • All necessary ports have been connected, but the misuse of the Controlled Voltage Source’s LConn1 (being connected twice) creates an error in the connection configuration.

Overall, while most aspects of the configuration meet requirements, the duplicate use of Controlled Voltage Source’s LConn1 is an inconsistency that must be resolved.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks listed in the used blocks are present in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No extra blocks appear; each block in the used list is present in the connection list.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names are correctly formatted with no forbidden “/” characters.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connections follow the required syntax and include parameter settings (e.g., for Sum) appropriately. The formatting is consistent with the guidelines.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The provided parameter setting for the Sum block (`Inputs` = `+-`) matches the expected configuration. All other connections require no explicit parameter settings.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • No dedicated input port (apart from allowed exceptions) is connected more than once. There are no duplicate lines using an input port more than once.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • Every connection is made between an output port (or non‐dedicated electrical conserving port) and an input port. All connections appear valid with regard to port types of their respective blocks.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Almost every port is connected; however, the Controlled Voltage Source block has three ports. While its LConn1 and RConn2 are connected (to Resistor 1 LConn1 and Electrical Reference 2 LConn1, respectively), its RConn1 (the input physical signal port) is not connected. This omission results in an incomplete network configuration.

Overall, aside from the missing connection for Controlled Voltage Source’s RConn1, all other aspects meet the requirements. The missing connection constitutes an error.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks listed in the simulation information (Pulse Generator, Controlled Voltage Source, Solver Configuration, Resistor, Capacitor, Electrical Reference, Voltage Sensor, PS‑Simulink Converter, Sum, Transfer Fcn, Scope, and Mux) appear in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • There are no extra blocks; every block from the provided list is present in the connection description.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names are correctly formatted without the forbidden "/" character.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Every connection is presented in the prescribed format. Each line is structured as "BlockName (BlockType) Port" on the left (output) and "BlockName (BlockType) Port" on the right (input), with parameter settings shown only when required (as with the Sum block’s `Inputs` = `+-`).

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The only parameter setting present is for the Sum block (`Inputs` = `+-`), which matches the expected configuration based on the simulation blocks description.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • No dedicated input port is connected more than once (except for the permitted exceptions of Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration). Even though some output ports (like those of the Mux and Pulse Generator) appear in multiple connections, that is permitted.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • All connections adhere to the proper assignment of output to input ports. For example, the Pulse Generator’s output is connected to both the Mux input and the Controlled Voltage Source’s input port (RConn1), and the Solver Configuration is connected via its RConn1 port (an I/O port) to multiple blocks, which is allowed as an exception. All block types and their connection roles match the simulation blocks description.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Every port covered in the simulation blocks description is connected at least once. All required ports on blocks such as the Controlled Voltage Source (LConn1, RConn1, and RConn2), Resistor (LConn1 and RConn1), Capacitor (LConn1 and RConn1), Voltage Sensor (LConn1, RConn1, and RConn2), PS‑Simulink Converter (LConn1 and its output port), Sum (both input ports and its output port), and others are accounted for.

Overall, the Investigator’s simulation connections description is consistent with the simulation blocks description and meets all eight responsibilities.

[Debug_locator] Below is the analysis report:

1. Error Source (primary 5–10 lines):  
• The error is triggered by the line that connects the Pulse Generator’s output to the RConn1 input of the Controlled Voltage Source:  
  eng.add_line(model_name, 'Pulse Generator/1', 'Controlled Voltage Source/RConn1', nargout=0)  
• This line is one of the electrical connection lines and occurs around line 39 of the code.

2. Additional Related Code Lines:  
• The earlier block addition calls for Pulse Generator and Controlled Voltage Source (lines adding 'Pulse Generator' and 'Controlled Voltage Source') set up the relevant blocks correctly.  
• Other electrical connections involving physical ports (e.g., connections for Resistor, Capacitor, and Electrical References) are present as specified in the Investigator’s details.  
• The overall electrical network connection configuration is implemented as specified, including connections using ports like LConn1, RConn1, and RConn2.

3. Assessment of Connections and Parameters:  
• The connection configuration and parameter settings in the code (block names and port selections) exactly match the Investigator’s Implementation Details.  
• However, the error “The points input cannot lie on objects that do not share the same Physical Modeling domain” indicates that a connection is being attempted between blocks from different modeling domains. In this case, the Pulse Generator (a pure Simulink block producing signals) is being electrically connected to a Controlled Voltage Source (a Simscape Electrical block expecting physical signals).  
• Since there is no mismatch in the block paths or port names—and all parameters follow the details—the error is not caused by an incorrect connection configuration. Rather, the error arises because the domain of the Pulse Generator does not match the physical domain expected by the Controlled Voltage Source.

Conclusion:  
Because the code’s connection configuration exactly adheres to the Investigator’s Implementation Details and all port parameters are set correctly, the error is caused by a discrepancy in the Investigator’s Implementation Details (i.e. attempting to connect blocks from different physical modeling domains).

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks specified in the simulation information are present in the connections description.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No extra blocks were identified; each block is accounted for in the connection list.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • Block names are formatted correctly with no forbidden characters.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • The connections follow the prescribed format with appropriate parameter settings shown where required.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The parameter settings (e.g., for the Sum block) are correct and consistent with the simulation block descriptions.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • No duplicate connections were detected; each dedicated input port is used only once (except for allowed exceptions).

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • While the connection configuration and port assignments are internally consistent, the Debug Locator report indicates an error due to a modeling domain mismatch. Specifically, the Pulse Generator (a Simulink signal generator) is electrically connected to the Controlled Voltage Source (a Simscape Electrical block expecting physical signals). This mix of different physical modeling domains is not allowed.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • All required ports have connections; however, the problematic connection between the Pulse Generator and the Controlled Voltage Source leads to a domain conflict that causes runtime issues.

Overall, the configuration adheres to the internal format and connection rules, but the domain mismatch between the Pulse Generator and the Controlled Voltage Source causes runtime errors. This inconsistency results in a failed unit test.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Block List Existence:
 • All blocks from the provided simulation information appear in the connection list except that the converter block is inconsistently named. The expected block “PS‑Simulink Converter” appears as two different names (“Simulink PS Converter” and “PS Simulink Converter”), which may cause ambiguity.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • No truly extra blocks are found; however, the inconsistent naming for the converter block results in an effective duplication that does not match the originally provided block list.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • Block names are free of forbidden characters. However, note that the converter block is labeled with “Simulink-PS Converter” in one instance and “PS-Simulink Converter” in another, which is not a formatting issue per se but an inconsistency in naming.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • All connection lines follow the prescribed format. The parameter setting for the Sum block is properly provided.
 • The connections involving the converter block are formatted correctly, though the inconsistent naming adds confusion.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The only parameter setting required (for the Sum block’s `Inputs` set to `+-`) is correctly applied.
 • All other parameters match the simulation blocks description.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • There are no instances where the same dedicated input port is connected more than once, aside from allowed exceptions. The duplicated use of the Mux output to Sum inputs is acceptable.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • Most connections obey the port type rules. However, a critical issue is present in the connection chain beginning at the Pulse Generator. The first connection is:
  Pulse Generator (Pulse Generator) 1 <-> Simulink PS Converter 1 (Simulink-PS Converter) 1
  followed by:
  Simulink PS Converter 1 (Simulink-PS Converter) 1 <-> Controlled Voltage Source (Controlled Voltage Source) RConn1
 • The intended converter block should bridge the Simulink domain to the physical (Simscape) domain. The inconsistent naming raises concern about whether the proper domain conversion block is used. This may lead to a domain mismatch error, as the Pulse Generator (a Simulink source) cannot directly interface with the Controlled Voltage Source (a physical block) without the correct converter. 

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Connections for each block (including Controlled Voltage Source, Resistor, Capacitor, Voltage Sensor, Solver Configuration, Mux, Sum, and Transfer Fcn) appear complete.
 • The problematic connection is not due to a missing link, but rather due to the domain conversion ambiguity introduced by the converter block’s mismatch. This affects the proper operation of the electrical network connection.

Overall, while the internal formatting and parameter settings strictly follow the investigator’s design, the inconsistency in naming and potentially using the wrong domain conversion block (or misnaming it) causes a critical error in the physical modeling domain. Therefore, the unit test cannot pass.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Review Report:

1. Exist of Block List:
 • All blocks listed in the simulation information are present in the connection description. The list includes both converter blocks – one named “Simulink‐PS Converter” and the other “PS‐Simulink Converter” – which match the provided block list.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • There are no extra blocks. Both converter blocks appear in the simulation information and are used appropriately in the connections.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • All block names are formatted correctly with no forbidden “/” characters. The naming (using hyphens) is consistent with the simulation blocks description.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Each connection is strictly formatted as “BlockName (BlockType) Port” on the left (output) and “BlockName (BlockType) Port” on the right (input). Parameter settings (e.g., for Sum’s ‘Inputs’ set to `+-`) are shown only when needed. The formatting is correct.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The only parameter setting provided is for the Sum block (`Inputs` = `+-`), which matches the simulation blocks description. All other connections require no extra parameter settings, and these are correctly omitted.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • No dedicated input port is connected more than once (except for allowed blocks like Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration). The Sum block uses distinct input ports (port 1 and port 2) for separate connections, so there are no duplicate connections.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The conversion chain is correctly implemented. The Pulse Generator (a Simulink source) is connected to the Simulink‐PS Converter (which bridges to the physical domain), and the physical Controlled Voltage Source receives its voltage signal appropriately. Similarly, the Voltage Sensor outputs a physical signal to the PS‐Simulink Converter, which then feeds the Simulink domain via the Mux. All ports are used according to their type (input, output, or bidirectional) as specified.
 • No block is connected in a way that violates the dedicated input/output port rules.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Every required port of each block is connected. For example, the Pulse Generator, both converter blocks, the Controlled Voltage Source (all its ports), Resistor, Capacitor, Electrical References, Voltage Sensor, Solver Configuration, Sum, Transfer Fcn, Scope, and Mux all have their connections completed as per the simulation blocks description.

Overall, the Investigator’s simulation connections description adheres to the simulation blocks description with proper formatting, parameter settings, port utilization, and no duplicate or improperly typed connections.

[Report_writer] Below is the complete technical report that integrates theoretical analysis with a step‐by‐step explanation of both the simulation structure and its MATLAB® code implementation.

──────────────────────────────
1. What Is the Simulation About?

The simulation models an RC circuit using both Simulink® signal connections and Simscape™ physical networks. The purpose is to demonstrate two different modeling approaches:  
• The Simulink model uses standard input/output blocks where signals are passed between blocks via mathematical equations derived from circuit theory.  
• The Simscape model directly represents physical interconnections through bidirectional energy exchange, allowing later expansion by simple copy–paste methods.  

In this example, the circuit is driven by a voltage square wave from a Pulse Generator, and the resistor and capacitor elements represent physical components with behavior described by Ohm’s law and the capacitor’s differential equation. This simulation stands as a real-world analog where electrical behavior under transient pulse excitation is studied, linking physical principles (e.g., V = IR and I = C·dV/dt) to simulation outputs that can be analyzed in the time domain.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Are the Main Simulation Steps?

The simulation can be logically divided into several distinct steps (or modules) that outline how the RC circuit is structured:

Step 1: Signal Generation  
• A Pulse Generator block creates a square-wave voltage signal that acts as the input excitation.  

Step 2: Signal Conversion for Physical Modeling  
• The generated signal is converted from a Simulink signal into a physical signal using the Simulink-PS Converter. This prepares the voltage signal for use in the physical network.

Step 3: Voltage Source and Electrical Connections  
• A Controlled Voltage Source receives the physical signal and supplies the prescribed voltage to the network.  
• This voltage drives the RC circuit built from a Resistor and a Capacitor arranged in series.

Step 4: Circuit Elements Modeling  
• The Resistor block implements Ohm’s law (V = I·R).  
• The Capacitor block models the dynamic relationship I(t) = C·dV/dt, capturing transient response.

Step 5: Grounding and Solver Settings  
• Electrical Reference blocks are included to set the ground (zero voltage reference).  
• A Solver Configuration block provides necessary environment settings for the physical simulation, ensuring that the network equations are solved accurately.

Step 6: Voltage Measurement and Post-Processing  
• A Voltage Sensor is placed in the circuit to measure the voltage across one of the RC elements.  
• Its output is converted back to a Simulink signal by a PS-Simulink Converter.
• The measured voltage is then processed via a Mux block, fed into a Sum block, and finally filtered or transformed by a Transfer Function block.

Step 7: Output Visualization  
• The final processed output (after summing and transfer function processing) is sent to a Scope block to plot the time evolution of the circuit voltage.

──────────────────────────────
3. Theoretical Knowledge and Mathematical Modelling in Each Step

Step 1: Signal Generation  
Theory:  
• The Pulse Generator is based on a simple time-dependent logic where a square wave is generated. It uses conditional logic (“if t ≥ delay then output = amplitude”) to simulate a digital input.  
• The design relates to time-domain signal processing.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• Logic-based mathematical conditions where signal amplitude is switched between 0 and a preset voltage level based on time.

Step 2: Signal Conversion for Physical Modeling  
Theory:  
• Conversion of Simulink signals to physical signals bridges the gap between abstract simulation and physical analog modeling in Simscape.  
• It ensures that the following blocks (which use physical laws) receive proper units and signal types.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• Consistency of signal types and unit conversion procedures to guarantee that voltages and currents follow physical units.

Step 3: Voltage Source and Electrical Connections  
Theory:  
• The Controlled Voltage Source block implements the controlled source concept found in circuit theory.  
• The source generates a voltage V = Vs regardless of current changes, mirroring an ideal source in theoretical models.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• The physical connection is governed by the controlled source equation and standard circuit nodal analysis.

Step 4: Circuit Elements Modeling  
Theory (Resistor):  
• The resistor follows Ohm’s law (V = I·R), one of the fundamental equations in circuit analysis.  
Theory (Capacitor):  
• The capacitor is modeled with the relation I(t) = C·dV/dt, which is the basis for analyzing transient responses in circuits.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• Differential equations describe capacitor behavior.
• Steady-state and transient analyses are supported by the resistor’s linear relationship.

Step 5: Grounding and Solver Settings  
Theory:  
• Ground (Electrical Reference) sets the zero voltage potential; all voltage measurements become relative to this point.  
• The Solver Configuration is based on numerical solution methods for differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) ensuring model stability and precision.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• The physical network requires correct boundary conditions (zero potential at ground).
• Numerical methods (e.g., variable-step solvers) are applied to solve the differential equations of the circuit.

Step 6: Voltage Measurement and Post-Processing  
Theory:  
• The Voltage Sensor block measures the potential difference, providing experimental data equivalent to measurements in physical systems.  
• The conversion back to a Simulink signal and subsequent processing (Mux, Sum, Transfer Function) involve signal conditioning and linear systems analysis.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• The Transfer Function block represents a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by numerator and denominator coefficients (typically used for filtering or dynamic response shaping).

Step 7: Output Visualization  
Theory:  
• Displaying the result using a Scope block aids in time-domain analysis typical in experimental and simulation settings.  
• Visualization confirms theoretical predictions against simulated data.

Mathematical Modeling:  
• Time-domain plot generation represents the integration of the circuit’s differential behavior over time.

4. How Is It Implemented in Code?

The provided Python script utilizes MATLAB® Engine to programmatically construct the Simulink model. The code is structured to align with the above simulation steps.

Step 1: Signal Generation  
• Code snippet creates a Pulse Generator block:

--------------------------------------------------
# Add Pulse Generator Block
eng.add_block('simulink/Sources/Pulse Generator', model_name + '/Pulse Generator', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
This command adds a Pulse Generator block to the system. The generated square-wave serves as the excitation for the circuit.

Step 2: Signal Conversion for Physical Modeling  
• Code snippet for Simulink-PS Converter:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('nesl_utility/Simulink-PS Converter', model_name + '/Simulink-PS Converter 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
The block translates the generated Simulink signal into a physical Signal appropriate for the Simscape physical network.

Step 3: Voltage Source and Electrical Connections  
• Code snippet for Controlled Voltage Source:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sources/Controlled Voltage Source', model_name + '/Controlled Voltage Source', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
This creates a voltage source that accepts the physical signal. The code later connects the physical output from the Simulink-PS Converter to this block, ensuring that the voltage input is correctly routed.

Step 4: Circuit Elements Modeling  
• Code snippet for Resistor and Capacitor blocks:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor', model_name + '/Resistor 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Capacitor', model_name + '/Capacitor 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
These blocks represent the electrical elements of the circuit. Their behavior is defined by the theoretical equations (Ohm’s law for the resistor and the charging equation for the capacitor).

Step 5: Grounding and Solver Settings  
• Code snippet includes Electrical Reference blocks and the Solver Configuration:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('nesl_utility/Solver Configuration', model_name + '/Solver Configuration', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Electrical Reference', model_name + '/Electrical Reference 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Electrical Reference', model_name + '/Electrical Reference 2', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
These commands set up the physical environment and grounding, ensuring that the circuit solves with a defined reference (ground) and appropriate simulation parameters.

Step 6: Voltage Measurement and Post-Processing  
• Code snippet for Voltage Sensor, PS-Simulink Converter, Mux, Sum, and Transfer Function:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sensors/Voltage Sensor', model_name + '/Voltage Sensor', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('nesl_utility/PS-Simulink Converter', model_name + '/PS-Simulink Converter 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Mux', model_name + '/Mux 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Sum', model_name + '/Sum 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Continuous/Transfer Fcn', model_name + '/Transfer Fcn 1', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)

# Set Sum and Mux parameters
eng.set_param(model_name + '/Sum 1', 'Inputs', '+-', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(model_name + '/Mux 1', 'Inputs', '2', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
• The Voltage Sensor captures the voltage across circuit elements.  
• The PS-Simulink Converter brings the measured physical signal back into the Simulink domain.  
• The Mux combines signals for further processing (here, two signals are merged).  
• The Sum (configured with inputs “+-”) is used to perform signal algebra (e.g., subtracting a reference).  
• The Transfer Function models an additional dynamic processing step (filtering or response shaping) as determined by its numerator and denominator coefficients.

Step 7: Output Visualization  
• Code snippet for Scope:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Scope', model_name + '/Output Voltage', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
The Scope block is added to display the time-domain response of the processed circuit output signal.

Final Assembly – Adding Lines/Connections:  
The remainder of the code uses eng.add_line() commands to connect the blocks as per the simulation block diagram. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Pulse Generator/1', 'Simulink-PS Converter 1/1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Simulink-PS Converter 1/RConn1', 'Controlled Voltage Source/RConn1', nargout=0)
...
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Transfer Fcn 1/1', 'Output Voltage/1', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:  
These commands physically connect the blocks—both for signal and electrical (physical) pathways. The code reflects the theoretical circuit topology by ensuring that the generated voltage, its manipulation through circuit elements, and final measurement are seamlessly integrated.

Finally, the code arranges the system layout and saves it as a Simulink model:
--------------------------------------------------
eng.Simulink.BlockDiagram.arrangeSystem(model_name, nargout=0)
eng.save_system(model_name, model_name + '.slx', nargout=0)
--------------------------------------------------
This ensures that the simulated model is visually organized and stored for further analysis.

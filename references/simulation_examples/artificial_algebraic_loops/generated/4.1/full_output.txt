[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review of the simulation information against the simulation blocks description:

1. Existence of block list:
 • The Investigator’s block list lists: Step (Step), sum 1 (Sum), Controller (Gain), Plant (Transfer Fcn), Scope (Scope). All expected blocks appear.

2. Extra blocks:
 • There are no extra blocks. Every block mentioned in the “blocks used in the simulation” is also used in the connections.

3. Formatting of block names:
 • None of the block names contain any forbidden special symbols (such as “/”). The names appear acceptable.

4. Formatting of connection description:
 • All connections follow the “Block (Block type) Port” format on each side.
 • However, the Sum block connections include a parameter setting text “(`Inputs` = depends on diagram, commonly `+-`)”. This text is not a proper parameter value as defined by the simulation blocks description. Parameter values should be exact (for example, a string such as “+-”) rather than an ambiguous note.

5. Validate parameter settings in connections:
 • The only parameter setting encountered is for the Sum block’s “Inputs” parameter. The simulation blocks description expects a string that exactly dictates the number and polarity of the inputs. The provided “depends on diagram, commonly `+-`” is ambiguous and does not meet the strict criteria.

6. Detect duplicate connections:
 • When checking dedicated input ports (for Sum, Gain, Transfer Fcn, and Scope), each block’s input port is connected only once. Although the same block appears more than once in the connection list, the instances always come from different roles (input vs. output). Therefore, no duplicate input port connection exists that violates the rules.

7. Validate block connection types:
 • The connection roles follow the required rule (left side always an output, right side always an input).
 • The blocks used (the step next to a sum input, a gain with its output and input used appropriately, Transfer Fcn driving Scope’s input, etc.) have been correctly connected with respect to their dedicated ports as defined in the simulation blocks description.

8. Verify complete port connections:
 • Step: Its only output (port 1) is connected (line 1).
 • Sum (sum 1): Its output is used (line 4) and its two input ports (ports 1 from line 1 and port 2 from line 5) are connected. (Note: the expected number of Sum inputs is determined via its “Inputs” parameter, but the provided parameter value is ambiguous.)
 • Gain (Controller): Its output (used in line 2) and input (used in line 4) are connected.
 • Transfer Fcn (Plant): Has its input (line 2) and output (used in lines 3 and 5) connected.
 • Scope: Its only input (port 1) is connected (line 3).

Summary of issues:

• The primary issue is with the parameter settings for Sum. The parameter “Inputs” must be stated as a clear string (for example “+-” or equivalent) rather than the ambiguous “depends on diagram, commonly `+-`”. This does not strictly match the expected configuration.
• While the overall connection directions, block participation, and pairing of ports are acceptable, this imprecise parameter specification causes the simulation information to fail the strict verification.

Based on these findings, there is at least one inconsistency.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review of the simulation information:

1. Existence of block list:
 • The provided list of blocks is: Step (Step), sum 1 (Sum), Controller (Gain), Plant (Transfer Fcn), and Scope (Scope). All expected blocks are listed.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • All blocks in the list appear in the connections; no extra blocks are found.

3. Formatting of block names:
 • None of the block names include the forbidden special symbol “/”. The block names are formatted correctly.

4. Formatting of connection description:
 • Each connection is formatted following the required pattern. For example, “Step (Step) 1” and “sum 1 (Sum) 1 (`Inputs` = `+-`)” appear correctly.
 • The parameter setting for the Sum block is provided as (`Inputs` = `+-`), which is acceptable.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Sum block uses the parameter “Inputs” and the value `+-` correctly. This matches the simulation blocks description where the string (e.g., “+-”) determines the two input ports.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • Each block’s dedicated input port is connected only once. For instance, the Sum block uses input port 1 in the connection with Step and input port 2 in the connection with Plant; Controller and Plant each use their dedicated ports in a single connection as input. No duplicate input connections are detected.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • The connections respect the roles of each port (left always output, right always input). For example, the Step block (with only output) drives Sum’s input, and the Scope (with only input) is driven by the output of Plant.
 • No block that has only an output or input is being misconnected.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Step’s only output (port 1) is connected.
 • Sum (Sum) has its two input ports (port 1 and port 2, as determined by `+-`) connected and its output (port 1) is used to drive Controller.
 • Controller (Gain) has its single input (from Sum) and output (to Plant) both connected.
 • Plant (Transfer Fcn) has both its dedicated input and output (even though its output is connected to two destinations, that is permitted for a dedicated output port).
 • Scope has its only input (port 1) connected.
 • All blocks have their complete required ports connected correctly.

Based on the above review, all responsibilities are met with no errors or inconsistencies.

[Report_writer] Below is the comprehensive report addressing the four key questions regarding the artificial_algebraic_loops simulation.

──────────────────────────────
1. What Is the Simulation About?
──────────────────────────────
This simulation models a simple closed-loop control system that intentionally embeds an artificial algebraic loop. In the simulated system, a fixed step input is generated and combined with the plant output through a summation operation. The resulting signal is scaled by a controller with a constant gain before being fed back into the plant, which is represented by a continuous transfer function. The overall objective is to study the behavior of a dynamic system with feedback and observe its time response through the scope display. This setup is typical in control systems analysis, where the interaction between the controller and the plant (and the interplay of algebraic loops) is essential to understand system stability and performance.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Are the Main Simulation Steps?
──────────────────────────────
The simulation is structured into the following distinct stages:

a. Signal Generation and Input  
 • A Step block generates a step input signal, which serves as the external excitation.

b. Signal Summation  
 • A Sum block takes two inputs (the step signal and the plant output) and combines them. The configuration (using the '+-' parameter) indicates that the first input is added while the second is subtracted. This summation forms part of the algebraic loop by feeding back the plant’s output.

c. Control Action  
 • A Gain block represents the controller. It multiplies the summation output by a constant controller gain, modifying the signal before it is applied to the plant.

d. Plant Dynamics  
 • A Transfer Function block models the plant dynamics using a continuous transfer function formulation. This block simulates the system behavior defined by numerator and denominator coefficients, representing the system’s differential equations.

e. Output Observation  
 • A Scope block captures and displays the time-domain response of the plant output, providing a visual representation of the system’s dynamics.

──────────────────────────────
3. What Theoretical Knowledge and Mathematical Modelling Are Involved in Each Step?
──────────────────────────────
a. Signal Generation and Input  
 Theory: The Step input is based on the Heaviside step function (u(t)) which is defined as:  
   u(t) = 0 for t < 0, and u(t) = 1 for t ≥ 0.  
 Modelling: This simple discontinuous function is frequently used to test system response and analyze transient behavior in control systems.

b. Signal Summation  
 Theory: The summation operation is linear in nature and is underpinned by the superposition principle.  
 Modelling: In a typical control loop, the combination of signals (typically error signals) is crucial in determining the corrective action. The algebraic loop created here implies that there exists a direct instantaneous relationship between the plant output and the controller input, necessitating careful numerical handling.

c. Control Action  
 Theory: The Gain block applies a linear scaling operation. The mathematical model is:  
   y(t) = K · e(t)  
 where K is the controller gain and e(t) is the input error signal.  
 Modelling: This simple proportional controller is often the first control strategy implemented in classical control theory.

d. Plant Dynamics  
 Theory: The plant is represented by a transfer function in the Laplace domain:  
   G(s) = N(s)/D(s)  
 where N(s) represents the numerator and D(s) the denominator polynomial in s.  
 Modelling: This representation corresponds to the system’s differential equations and facilitates analysis of stability and frequency response through poles and zeros.

e. Output Observation  
 Theory: Signal visualization in the time domain helps in observing transient and steady-state behaviors, as predicted by time-domain analysis in system dynamics.  
 Modelling: The Scope block does not alter the signal but acts as a real-time observer of the system’s output characteristics.

──────────────────────────────
4. How Is It Implemented in Code?
──────────────────────────────
The simulation is built using MATLAB’s Simulink engine accessed via the MATLAB Engine API for Python. The code is structured to mirror the stepwise construction of the simulation:

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
a. Creating the Model and Adding the Step Block  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
The following code initializes a new Simulink model and inserts a Step block to produce a step input signal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/matlabengine-24.2-py3.10.egg')
import matlab.engine

# Start the MATLAB engine and create a new Simulink model.
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
model_name = 'simulation_model'
eng.new_system(model_name, nargout=0)
eng.open_system(model_name, nargout=0)

# Add the Step block which represents the step input.
eng.add_block('simulink/Sources/Step', model_name + '/Step', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• A new system is created where the Step block, based on the Heaviside function, is added without any input port.  
• This forms the source of the simulation’s external excitation.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
b. Adding and Configuring the Sum Block  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
The Sum block is added next with its operation configuration set to '+-', meaning it will add the first input and subtract the second.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add the Sum block with the Inputs parameter set to '+-' to define two input ports.
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Sum', model_name + '/sum', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(model_name + '/sum', 'Inputs', '+-', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• This block executes the linear algebraic sum described by the superposition principle in theory.  
• It sets up the artificial algebraic loop by subtracting the plant output from the step input.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
c. Adding the Controller Gain Block  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
The Gain block (controller) multiplies the sum output by a predefined constant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add the Gain block (Controller) that implements the proportional control law.
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Gain', model_name + '/Controller', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• In theory, the Gain multiplies the error signal by a constant K, as per proportional control.  
• The code places the Gain block between the summing operation and the plant block.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
d. Adding the Plant Transfer Function Block  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
The plant is modeled using a Transfer Function block that encapsulates its continuous-time dynamics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add the Transfer Function block (Plant) that simulates the plant dynamics.
eng.add_block('simulink/Continuous/Transfer Fcn', model_name + '/Plant', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• This block takes in the controller output and produces the plant response using the transfer function formulation G(s) = N(s)/D(s).  
• It reflects the mathematical modelling of system dynamics through differential equations.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
e. Adding the Scope Block for Output Observation  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
To observe the simulation results, a Scope block is added to the model.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add the Scope block to display the time-domain signals for the plant output.
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Scope', model_name + '/Scope', 'MakeNameUnique', 'on', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• The Scope block is used as an observer similar to a measurement instrument in an experimental setup, showing real-time system output.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
f. Interconnecting the Blocks  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
After adding the blocks, the next series of commands connect them to form the closed-loop structure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Connect the blocks according to their defined ports.

# Connect Step block's output to the first input of the Sum block.
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Step/1', 'sum/1', nargout=0)

# Connect the Plant block's output to the second input of the Sum block.
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Plant/1', 'sum/2', nargout=0)

# Connect the output of the Sum block to the input of the Controller (Gain block).
eng.add_line(model_name, 'sum/1', 'Controller/1', nargout=0)

# Connect the Controller block's output to the Plant block's input.
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Controller/1', 'Plant/1', nargout=0)

# Connect the Plant block's output to the Scope block for signal visualization.
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Plant/1', 'Scope/1', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• These lines establish the feedback loop. The Step and Plant blocks feed into the Sum block (implementing the algebraic loop), then the adjusted signal is processed by the Gain block, and finally, the modified signal drives the Plant again.  
• The final connection sends the plant output to the Scope for visualization, tying together the theory of feedback control with its practical implementation.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
g. Finalizing the System  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
The simulation concludes with commands to arrange, save, and finalize the system configuration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Automatically arrange the blocks for clarity.
eng.Simulink.BlockDiagram.arrangeSystem(model_name, nargout=0)

# Save the configured system as an SLX file.
eng.save_system(model_name, model_name + '.slx', nargout=0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  
• The arrangeSystem command helps in auto-organizing the layout for easier readability.  
• Saving the system persists the simulation model for future execution or analysis.

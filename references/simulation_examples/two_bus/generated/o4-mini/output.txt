Below is the comprehensive report addressing the four key questions.

──────────────────────────────
1. What is the simulation about?

This simulation implements a load-flow analysis on a simple two-bus, three-phase power network. In this model, two busbars represent the nodes in a transmission system: one acting as the swing (slack) bus and the other incorporating both a PV bus and a PQ load. The swing bus regulates its terminal voltage to serve as the reference (nominal voltage) whereas the PV bus is configured to maintain a slightly elevated voltage (1.025 times the rated value) while supplying 80 MW of active power. The PQ load is modeled to extract power from the network. Connected by a three-phase transmission line that emulates the real impedances, inductances, and capacitances of a power line, the simulation replicates the steady-state power flow conditions between buses. The simulation uses specific blocks (from Simscape Electrical™ libraries), including Load Flow Source blocks (for swing, PV, and PQ buses), Busbar blocks (to display voltages, phase differences, and active/reactive powers), and Transmission Line blocks (to model network line parameters) to achieve load flow initialization and dynamic connectivity reflective of a real-world power distribution system.

2. What are the main simulation steps?

Although we do not describe the code implementation in this section, the simulation structure can be broken down into distinct functional modules:

a) Definition of Network Nodes and Sources:
 • A swing bus is defined as an ideal voltage source with a regulated nominal voltage.
 • A PV bus is implemented as a voltage-regulated block delivering a prescribed active power output.
 • A PQ load is modeled as a load source that specifies the power demanded.

b) Busbar Implementation and Load Flow Initialization:
 • Busbar blocks aggregate and display simulation results (voltages, phase angles, active and reactive power flows) at the corresponding nodes. They are set up with a configurable number of nodes to capture multiple connection points.

c) Transmission Line Modeling:
 • A three-phase transmission line block simulates the physical characteristics of the connecting line. It employs lumped-parameter models (pi-model) based on self and mutual impedance, as well as line capacitances, ensuring an accurate representation of power transfer between buses.
 
d) Interconnection and Solver Configuration:
 • An electrical reference (ground) and a solver configuration block are connected to ensure numerical convergence and provide the necessary physical network environment. All nodes, loads, and lines are connected through well-defined three-phase connections following the designed block diagram.

e) Load Flow Computation:
 • A Simscape initialization (load flow solver) calculates the appropriate internal voltage amplitudes and phase angles. This ensures that the principle of power balance is upheld across the network before simulation, resulting in a steady-state solution that honors the requested terminal conditions.

──────────────────────────────
3. What theoretical knowledge and mathematical modelling are involved in each step?

a) Network Nodes and Sources:
 • The swing bus, PV bus, and PQ load blocks derive from power system analysis fundamentals. In steady-state load flow studies, the swing bus defines the voltage reference and balances system mismatches, while the PV and PQ nodes enforce power and voltage constraints. The theoretical foundation relies on Kirchhoff’s laws and the AC power flow equations (nonlinear relationships between voltage magnitudes, phase angles, active, and reactive powers).

b) Busbar Implementation:
 • Busbars are used to consolidate system variables. The load flow solution employs iterative methods (e.g., Newton–Raphson) where the busbars capture voltage magnitudes and phase angles as state variables. The mathematical modelling includes balance equations for active and reactive power, ensuring that the sum of generated and consumed power in the network satisfies energy conservation and impedance drop relations.

c) Transmission Line Modeling:
 • The transmission line is modeled using a lumped-parameter pi-model that considers resistance (R), self-inductance, mutual inductance, line-to-line capacitance, and line-to-ground capacitance. The mathematical framework relies on differential equations for distributed circuit elements transformed with Clarke’s transformation (for handling three-phase systems), thus enabling the simulation of dynamic electromagnetic flux relationships during steady state.

d) Interconnection and Solver Configuration:
 • The connection scheme is based on nodal analysis and the concept of a common reference (ground). The solver configuration incorporates numerical methods for index reduction and convergence (iterative solvers for nonlinear algebraic equations) that ensure stable and accurate simulation of the interconnected electrical network.
 
e) Load Flow Computation:
 • The load flow algorithm uses iterative solvers to adjust the unknown voltage magnitudes and phase angles so that all network power balance equations are satisfied. The underlying math comprises power system network equations derived from Kirchhoff’s currently, complemented by nonlinear solvers that address the inherently nonlinear nature of AC power flow.

4. How is it implemented in code?

The code provided below implements the simulation in a stepwise fashion to reflect the above theory and structure. The organized code sections map to the simulation steps described earlier:

──────────────────────────────
Step 1: Define the Network Nodes and Sources

• Create a new Simulink model.
• Add the Load Flow Source block three times for the swing bus, PQ load, and PV bus.  
• The swing bus and PV bus are parameterized according to their voltage regulation requirements, while the PQ load is set to model the load demand.

sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/matlabengine-24.2-py3.10.egg')
import matlab.engine

eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()

model_name = 'SimulatedNetworkModel'
eng.new_system(model_name, nargout=0)
eng.open_system(model_name, nargout=0)

# Add Load Flow Source blocks for Swing, PQ, and PV
eng.add_block('ee_lib/Sources/Load Flow Source', model_name + '/Swing_bus', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('ee_lib/Sources/Load Flow Source', model_name + '/PQ_load_1', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('ee_lib/Sources/Load Flow Source', model_name + '/PV_bus', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
-------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
This section sets up the three-phase voltage source components. The swing bus is the reference, PQ load represents the power demand, and the PV bus delivers the prescribed 80 MW at 1.025 times rated voltage.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2: Implement Busbar Blocks and Load Flow Reporting

• Add Busbar blocks which not only serve as nodes but also display simulation outputs such as voltage, phase angles, active and reactive power.
• Configure the Busbar blocks (setting n_nodes = 3) so that each bus can report multiple connectivity points as required by the network design.

Code Snippet:
-------------------------------------------------
eng.add_block('ee_lib/Connectors & References/Busbar', model_name + '/Busbar1', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('ee_lib/Connectors & References/Busbar', model_name + '/Busbar2', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Set parameters for Busbar blocks (n_nodes = 3)
eng.set_param(model_name + '/Busbar1', 'n_nodes', '3', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(model_name + '/Busbar2', 'n_nodes', '3', nargout=0)
-------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
This code configures the busbars that will display the load flow results after simulation. Their configuration, including the n_nodes parameter, ensures proper mapping of load flow conditions (voltage, phase, power flows) according to the theoretical network nodal analysis.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3: Incorporate Transmission Line and Additional Electrical Elements

• Add the Transmission Line (Three-Phase) block to model the physical interconnection using lumped-parameter models.
• Add auxiliary blocks such as Electrical Reference and Wye-Connected Load to provide the necessary network grounding and load representation.
• Also include a Solver Configuration block to set the simulation environment.

eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Electrical Reference', model_name + '/Electrical_Reference_6', 'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
-------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
These blocks incorporate the transmission line, modeled through a lumped pi-equivalent circuit, and the required electrical references (ground connections) for proper circuit definition. The Wye-Connected Load further models the actual load present on the network. The solver configuration block sets up parameters for numerical convergence consistent with the theoretical network equations.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4: Create Electrical Interconnections Reflecting the Theoretical Block Diagram

• Establish connections between blocks to mimic the physical wiring and signal flow in a power system:  
 – The swing bus connects to Busbar1  
 – The wye-connected load is linked to Busbar1 and the solver configuration  
 – The transmission line connects Busbar1 and Busbar2  
 – The PQ load and PV bus are connected to Busbar2 with their corresponding ground references.
• Finally, arrange the system and save it.

eng.add_line(model_name, 'PV_bus/RConn1', 'Electrical_Reference_6/LConn1', nargout=0)

# Arrange the system and save
eng.Simulink.BlockDiagram.arrangeSystem(model_name, nargout=0)
eng.save_system(model_name, model_name + '.slx', nargout=0)
-------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
This final code segment details the electrical interconnections. Each call to eng.add_line() establishes a connection between the designated ports on the blocks. The connectivity strictly follows the network topology and ensures that the simulation meets the physical conservation laws. Once all interconnections are made, the system is arranged for clarity and then saved.

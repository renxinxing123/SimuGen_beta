Below is the comprehensive technical report that integrates a theoretical description of the simulation, a breakdown of its main steps (without referring directly to raw code details), an explanation of the underlying mathematical and modeling concepts, and a step‐by‐step mapping to the code implementation.

──────────────────────────────
1. What Is the Simulation About?

The simulation models a small-signal bipolar transistor used in a common‐emitter amplifier configuration. In this representation, a BC107 Group B transistor is approximated by its hybrid-parameter small-signal equivalent model. The simulation’s purpose is to assess the amplifier’s performance, particularly its voltage gain (approximately –47 in this case) using a simple set of passive and controlled source elements. Key elements include:  
• An AC voltage source that provides a sinusoidal excitation (simulating a small-signal input).  
• A capacitor that serves as a decoupling element, ensuring that its negligible impedance at the signal frequency isolates the AC signal from DC biasing.  
• Resistors (including a bias resistor and load resistor) that define the operating point, control the DC currents, and set the output load.  
• Controlled sources (voltage-controlled voltage source and current-controlled current source) that mimic the small-signal transistor parameters (such as h_ie, h_fe, h_oe, and h_re) and implement the amplification behavior.  
• A voltage sensor and signal conversion blocks that allow measurement and visualization of the resulting output signal on a Scope.  

In summary, the simulation replicates an electrical circuit that captures both the biasing and small-signal amplification behavior found in a common-emitter configuration, while also demonstrating how complex devices (like transistors) can be constructed from fundamental elements provided in the Simscape Foundation library.

2. What Are the Main Simulation Steps?

The simulation is organized into the following distinct steps or modules:

A. Input Signal Generation  
 • Use an AC Voltage Source to generate a sinusoidal excitation.  
 • The AC source creates V(t) = V0 sin(2πft + φ).

B. Signal Decoupling and Biasing  
 • Pass the AC voltage through a decoupling Capacitor.  
 • Apply proper biasing with a resistor (RBias) to set the transistor’s operating point.

C. Transistor Equivalent Modeling  
 • Implement a Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) block to represent the base-emitter behavior and internal resistances of the transistor.  
 • Connect additional resistors (R1 and R2) that form part of the bias network bringing in the hybrid-parameter characteristics.  
 • Use a Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS) block to simulate the transistor’s current amplification property (reflecting the forward current gain h_fe).

D. Load and Measurement  
 • Include a load resistor (RLoad) where the amplified signal is developed.  
 • Sense the output voltage using a Voltage Sensor connected in parallel to the load.  
 • Convert the sensor’s physical signal to a Simulink signal using a PS-Simulink Converter and display it on a Scope.

3. What Theoretical Knowledge and Mathematical Modelling Are Involved in Each Step?

A. Input Signal Generation  
 Theory: The AC Voltage Source is based on sinusoidal function theory (V(t)= V0 sin(2πft+φ)). This provides the small-signal excitation necessary for linearizing the transistor’s behavior.  
 Mathematical Model: The amplitude, frequency, and phase dictate the voltage waveform, which when applied, allows for analyzing frequency response.

B. Signal Decoupling and Biasing  
 Theory:  
  – The Capacitor is modeled using I(t) = C · dV/dt. It blocks DC while allowing AC to pass when its impedance is negligible relative to the circuit’s resistive elements.  
  – The resistor follows Ohm’s Law (V = I · R) and is used to set proper DC bias virtually “fixing” the transistor’s operating point by dividing voltage.  
 Mathematical Model:  
  – Capacitor’s impedance X_C = 1/(2πfC) ensures that at 1 kHz the decoupling condition (negligible impedance compared to h_ie) holds.  
  – The ratio of the load resistor and the base internal resistor establishes the expected gain (approximately –h_fe*RLoad/h_ie).

C. Transistor Equivalent Modeling  
 Theory: Hybrid-parameter modeling involves representing the transistor with elements (resistances and controlled sources) that capture its small-signal behavior.  
 Mathematical Model:  
  – The Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) implements the input resistance h_ie and reverse transfer properties (h_re), while the resistor network (R1, R2, RBias) works together with the capacitor to mimic the transistor’s biasing network.  
  – The Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS) models the forward current gain h_fe such that I2 = h_fe·I1. This controlled amplification is key in defining the voltage gain of the circuit.

D. Load and Measurement  
 Theory:  
  – The load resistor (modeled by Ohm’s Law) develops an output voltage determined by the amplified current flowing through it.  
  – The Voltage Sensor converts the analog electrical voltage into a measurable physical signal.  
  – The PS-Simulink Converter block then converts the physical signal into a Simulink signal for digital visualization using a Scope.  
 Mathematical Model:  
  – The calculated output voltage approximately equals 47 * 10 mV = 0.47 V peak given the gain and input amplitude.

E. Overall Simulation Environment  
 Theory: The Solver Configuration block ensures that network conservation laws (Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws) are enforced during simulation, while the Electrical Reference defines the ground potential.  
 Mathematical Model: Numerical solvers integrate the differential algebraic equations that arise from combining the above elements.

4. How Is It Implemented in Code?

The following code segments show how the theoretical simulation steps are translated into a working Simscape/Simulink model. The code is organized to reflect each simulation step with added comments to explain the correspondence between theory and implementation.

──────────────────────────────
A. Input Signal Generation

Theory: A sinusoidal AC voltage source is used to excite the circuit.  
Implementation:  
 • The AC Voltage Source block is added and connected to the decoupling network.

Code Example:
------------------------------------------------
# Add AC Voltage Source for sinusoidal excitation
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sources/AC Voltage Source', 
              model_name + '/AC Voltage Source', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', 
              nargout=0)
------------------------------------------------
This line creates the AC Voltage Source block that produces a voltage V(t) = V0 sin(2πft + φ).

──────────────────────────────
B. Signal Decoupling and Biasing

Theory:  
 • A Capacitor is added to decouple the AC signal ensuring that the capacitor’s impedance is negligible at the operating frequency.  
 • A resistor (RBias) sets the proper bias point.

Implementation:  
 • The Capacitor block and the bias resistor (RBias) are added and connected to the AC source.

Code Example:
------------------------------------------------
# Add decoupling capacitor for AC coupling
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Capacitor', 
              model_name + '/C1', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)
              
# Add resistor RBias for biasing
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor', 
              model_name + '/RBias', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Create connections:
eng.add_line(model_name, 'AC Voltage Source/LConn1', 'C1/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'AC Voltage Source/RConn1', 'RBias/LConn1', nargout=0)
------------------------------------------------
Here, the AC voltage feeds into the capacitor (C1) and the RBias block, thus establishing both the AC path and the bias circuit.

──────────────────────────────
C. Transistor Equivalent Modeling

Theory:  
 • A Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) is used to emulate the transistor’s base-emitter characteristics.  
 • Additional resistors (R1, R2) and controlled sources represent the internal transistor parameters and the effect of bias network.  
 • A Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS) simulates the amplification gain.

Implementation:  
 • The VCVS and subsequent resistor blocks are added with their defined connections to mimic the hybrid model.
 • Then, the CCCS is inserted to produce the amplified output based on the input current.

Code Example:
------------------------------------------------
# Add Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source representing transistor's internal behavior
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sources/Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source', 
              model_name + '/Voltage-Controlled Voltage source', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Add resistor R1 as part of the bias network
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor', 
              model_name + '/R1', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Add Current-Controlled Current Source for modeling transistor gain (h_fe)
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sources/Current-Controlled Current Source', 
              model_name + '/Current-Controlled Current source', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Add resistor RLoad that serves as the load resistor
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor', 
              model_name + '/RLoad', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Add resistor R2 to complete the resistor network forming part of the transistor sub-circuit
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor', 
              model_name + '/R2', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Establish interconnections:
eng.add_line(model_name, 'C1/RConn1', 'Voltage-Controlled Voltage source/LConn2', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'RBias/RConn1', 'Voltage-Controlled Voltage source/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage-Controlled Voltage source/RConn2', 'R1/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'R1/RConn1', 'Current-Controlled Current source/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Current-Controlled Current source/RConn1', 'RLoad/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Current-Controlled Current source/LConn2', 'R2/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'R2/RConn1', 'Voltage-Controlled Voltage source/RConn1', nargout=0)
------------------------------------------------
In these lines, we first connect the output of the decoupling stage to the transistor model. The VCVS block uses inputs from both the capacitor (representing the AC signal) and the bias resistor (RBias) before its output drives resistor R1. The CCCS then uses the current at R1 to deliver an amplified current that is later converted into a voltage across RLoad according to Ohm’s law.

──────────────────────────────

 • PS-Simulink Converter and Scope blocks allow for presentation of the measured signal in the Simulink environment.

Implementation:  
 • A Voltage Sensor is placed across the load resistor and its output is routed through the PS-Simulink Converter to a Scope.

Code Example:
------------------------------------------------
# Add Voltage Sensor to measure the output voltage across the load
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sensors/Voltage Sensor', 
              model_name + '/Voltage sensor',

              model_name + '/PS-Simulink Converter', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Add a Scope for time-domain visualization of the output
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Scope', 
              model_name + '/Scope', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Create electrical reference (ground)
eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Electrical Reference', 
              model_name + '/Electrical Reference', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Connect Voltage sensor to PS-Simulink Converter and eventually to Scope:
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Current-Controlled Current source/LConn2', 'Voltage sensor/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage sensor/RConn1', 'PS-Simulink Converter/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'PS-Simulink Converter/1', 'Scope/1', nargout=0)

# Connect load resistor and other nodes to the Electrical Reference (Ground)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'RLoad/RConn1', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'RBias/RConn1', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage-Controlled Voltage source/RConn2', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage sensor/RConn2', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Current-Controlled Current source/RConn2', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
------------------------------------------------
These steps ensure that the output voltage developed at RLoad is sensed by the voltage sensor, converted into a digital signal using PS-Simulink Converter, and then displayed on the Scope. The electrical reference block sets the ground potential, crucial for circuit simulations.

──────────────────────────────
E. Overall Simulation Environment

Theory:  
 • The Solver Configuration block defines the simulation’s numerical settings and ensures the network of physical conservation laws is correctly handled.

Implementation:  
 • The Solver Configuration block is added and connected to one of the sensor lines (or another node), binding the simulation together.
 
Code Example:
------------------------------------------------
# Add Solver Configuration to set simulation parameters
eng.add_block('nesl_utility/Solver Configuration', 
              model_name + '/Solver Configuration', 
              'MakeNameUnique','on', nargout=0)

# Connect the Voltage sensor to the Solver Configuration block to propagate solver settings
eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage sensor/RConn1', 'Solver Configuration/RConn1', nargout=0)

# Finally, arrange and save the system
eng.Simulink.BlockDiagram.arrangeSystem(model_name, nargout=0)
eng.save_system(model_name, model_name + '.slx', nargout=0)
------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

This report has presented a detailed account of a small-signal bipolar transistor simulation that employs a common-emitter amplifier configuration. The simulation proceeds from generating a sinusoidal input, biasing the network, and modeling the transistor’s small-signal behavior using controlled source elements, to finally measuring the output signal which is displayed in a scope. Each simulation block is based on established theories—from sinusoidal steady-state analysis, capacitor impedance, and Ohm’s Law, to the formulation of hybrid transistor models—and is implemented in code via a structured sequence of MATLAB Simscape/Simulink API calls. This integrated approach illustrates both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation aspects of electronic circuit simulation.

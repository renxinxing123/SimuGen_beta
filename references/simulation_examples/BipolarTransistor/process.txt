[Iteration 1] Investigator reviewer result: Below is the summary of our review:

1. Extra Blocks Check:
 – All blocks that were listed as “used in the simulation” appear in at least one connection.
 – (Note that the investigator used distinct resistor labels – R1, R2, RBias and RLoad – which are all “Resistor” blocks. This is acceptable.)

2. Block Name Formatting:
 – No block name included the special symbol “/”. (Block names such as “Voltage-Controlled Voltage source” are acceptable despite minor capitalization differences.)

3. Connection Description Formatting:
 – Each connection line is written as “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” on each side of “<->”, and no extra explanation is shown.
 – The formatting is observed except that one must ensure that the “related parameter setting” part is omitted when not needed. Here none is provided, which is acceptable.

4. Parameter Settings Validation:
 – No parameter settings were provided; thus there is no mismatch against expectations (and the ports used match the block definitions from the simulation blocks list).

5. Duplicate Connections and Complete Port Connections:
 – Our review uncovered that certain block ports are used twice. For example:
  • The Voltage‐Controlled Voltage Source’s port LConn2 is used as the output in 
   “Voltage-Controlled Voltage source (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source) LConn2 <-> Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn1”
   and as the input in 
   “R1 (Resistor) LConn1 <-> Voltage-Controlled Voltage source (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source) LConn2”. This means the same physical port is connected twice.
  • Likewise, the Current-Controlled Current Source’s port LConn2 is used as the output in one connection (“Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2 <-> R2 (Resistor) LConn1”) and again as the input in (“Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 <-> Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2”).
  • Also, the AC Voltage Source’s port LConn1 appears in both “Voltage-Controlled Voltage source (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source) LConn1 <-> AC Voltage Source (AC Voltage Source) LConn1” and “C1 (Capacitor) LConn1 <-> AC Voltage Source (AC Voltage Source) LConn1”.
 – These duplicate port uses (on non‐exempt blocks; Electrical Reference, for example, is the allowed exception) mean that some output or input ports are connected more than once. In addition, every port is expected to have a single connection; duplicating a physical port (even if “switched” between left and right) is an inconsistency.

Conclusion:
There are errors in port connection completeness – namely duplicate use of non‐exempt ports (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source LConn2, Current-Controlled Current Source LConn2, and AC Voltage Source LConn1 appear twice). These issues violate the rule that every input and output port (except for the allowed Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration cases) should have one unique connection and duplication on the same physical port is not acceptable.

[Iteration 2] Investigator reviewer result: Below is the summary of our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block listed as “used in the simulation” appears in at least one connection. No extra blocks are detected.

2. Formatting of Block Name  
 • All block names are provided without the special symbol “/”. However, note that the block labels and real block names (e.g. “Voltage-Controlled Voltage source (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source)”) are acceptable under the current guidelines.

3. Connection Description Formatting  
 • In several connections an extra explanation is appended. For example, connection 13 ends with “(Removed duplicate connection from previous description)” and connection 15 similarly appends extra text. Per the guidelines, no extra explanation (other than an optional parameter setting) should be present.  
 • Otherwise, the general “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format is followed.

4. Parameter Settings Validation  
 • No explicit parameter settings were provided; therefore there is no mismatch with the simulation blocks list.

5. Duplicate Connections  
 • There is a violation concerning duplicate connections. For example, AC Voltage Source’s port LConn1 appears twice as input (in connection 4 and again in connection 13) even though AC Voltage Source is not an exempt block.  
 • Similarly, the resistor RLoad’s port LConn1 is connected twice (once in connection 7 and again in connection 15) on its input side.  
 • These duplicate connections on non‐exempt ports violate the requirement that a given non‐exempt block’s input port be connected only once.

6. Validate Block Connection Types and Complete Port Connections  
 • Although every block’s ports are connected, the duplicate connection issues identified in item 5 imply that some input ports (AC Voltage Source LConn1 and RLoad LConn1) are being used more than once, which is unacceptable.

In summary, the extra appended text in some connection lines violates the strict formatting requirement, and duplicate input port connections are present on non‐exempt blocks.

[Iteration 3] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block listed as “used in the simulation” appears in at least one connection. No extra blocks were detected.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are provided without any special symbol (i.e. no “/”). The block names follow the expected format.

3. Connection Description Formatting  
 • Every connection is given in the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format on each side of the “<->” with no additional comments or explanation. This requirement is met.

4. Parameter Settings Validation  
 • No parameter settings were provided in any connection (which is acceptable) and the ports used match those defined in the simulation blocks list.

5. Duplicate Connections  
 • There is a duplicate connection to Scope’s input port “1” (Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1 <-> Scope (Scope) 1 appears twice).  
 • Also, the Resistor RLoad’s port LConn1 is connected twice (once when Current-Controlled Current Source (LConn2) is connected to RLoad LConn1 and again when Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 connects to the same RLoad LConn1).  
 • Since Scope and RLoad are not in the allowed exception list, these duplicate input port connections are errors.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • There is no evidence that a block with only outputs is connected to one that has only outputs, or that a block with only inputs is connected to another only-input block. (All blocks used are bidirectional or have the appropriate mix of ports.)

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Some blocks do not have all of their ports connected appropriately. In particular, the Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source has four ports available (LConn1, RConn1, LConn2, RConn2) but only LConn1 and RConn1 appear, and each of them is used more than once. This both creates duplicate connections and leaves ports LConn2 and RConn2 unassigned, violating the rule that, under the set parameter settings, every port should have one (unique) connection.

In summary, while the formatting and block usage are acceptable, duplicate non‐exempt connections and incomplete port connectivity (especially for the Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source, Scope, and RLoad) result in rule violations.

[Iteration 4] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block from the “blocks used in the simulation” list appears in the connection description. No extra blocks were detected.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are provided without the special symbol “/”; the format “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” is used throughout.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Each connection is listed strictly as “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” on each side of “<->” with no extra parameter explanation. The formatting meets the requirements.

4. Parameter Settings Validation  
 • No parameter settings are provided in any connection, which is acceptable since none were required by the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • The same physical port on a non‐exempt block is used more than once. In particular, the Current-Controlled Current source’s conserving port LConn2 appears twice—once as the output (left side in line 13:  
  “Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2 <-> RLoad (Resistor) LConn1”) and again as the input (right side in line 16:  
  “Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 <-> Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2”). This violates the rule that a given non‐exempt input port must have a single connection.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The Voltage Sensor block is defined with RConn1 as its physical signal output port. However, in line 16 the Voltage Sensor’s LConn1 (an electrical conserving terminal, not the output) is used as if it were an output. This improper use of a measurement terminal further violates the expected connection type.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Because of the duplicate use of Current-Controlled Current source LConn2 and the incorrect use of Voltage Sensor’s LConn1, the port connectivity does not completely and correctly adhere to the network requirements.

In summary, the connection description has two main issues: a duplicate connection on Current-Controlled Current source port LConn2 and an incorrect use of Voltage Sensor’s LConn1 instead of its designated output RConn1. Both issues violate the simulation connection rules.

[Iteration 5] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block in the “blocks used in the simulation” list appears in the connections description. No extra blocks were found.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are provided without the special symbol “/” and follow the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Each connection is given strictly in the required format with no extra text or parameter explanation. The formatting is correct.

4. Parameter Settings Validation  
 • No parameter settings were provided and none were expected by the simulation blocks list. This is acceptable.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • One issue arises with the Resistor block “RLoad”: its port LConn1 is connected twice – once from the Current-Controlled Current source (LConn2 <-> RLoad LConn1 in connection 13) and once from the Voltage sensor (Voltage sensor LConn1 <-> RLoad LConn1 in connection 17). Since RLoad is not in the exception list, this duplicate connection on the same input port is an error.
 • In addition, note that the Current-Controlled Current source’s port “RConn2” is used inconsistently. In connection 10 it appears on the right-hand side (thus used as an input) while in connection 14 it appears on the left-hand side (thus used as an output). A given physical port must be used only in one direction.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The conflicting usage of the Current-Controlled Current source’s RConn2 (input in one connection and output in another) indicates an improper connection type. Also, the duplicate connection issue with RLoad shows that an input port of a non-exempt block is connected more than once.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • While every block has some of its ports connected, the issues noted above (duplicate connections and conflicting port direction) indicate that the port connectivity is not consistent with the expected single unique connection per (non‐exempt) input port.

In summary, although the overall formatting and block listing are acceptable, there are duplicate/contradictory connections (specifically for RLoad’s LConn1 and Current-Controlled Current source’s RConn2) that violate the connection rules.

[Iteration 6] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block listed as “used in the simulation” (including the multiple resistor instances: R1, R2, RBias, and RLoad) appears at least once in the connections description. No extra blocks were found.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are presented without the special symbol “/” and follow the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Each connection is listed according to the prescribed format without any extra parameter explanation. The formatting is correctly applied.

4. Parameter Settings Validation  
 • No parameter settings were provided in any connection, which is acceptable since none were required by the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • There is a duplicate connection issue for the resistor RLoad. Its port LConn1 is used in two separate connections (once in “Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2 <-> RLoad (Resistor) LConn1” and again in “Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 <-> RLoad (Resistor) LConn1”). Since RLoad is not an exception (Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration are the only exceptions), this constitutes a duplicate connection.
 • In addition, the Voltage Sensor block is used inconsistently. Its physical signal output port is defined as RConn1, yet in the connection with RLoad the block uses LConn1. This misassignment of an output port is another error.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The conflicting usage of the Voltage Sensor port (using LConn1 instead of the designated output RConn1) violates the expected connection type.
 • Apart from that, no block that has only outputs is connected to one that has only inputs.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Almost every block’s ports are connected as required. However, because of the duplicate connection on RLoad’s LConn1 (and the improper use of Voltage Sensor’s LConn1 for an output signal), some ports have conflicting or multiple assignments, which does not fulfill the requirement for one unique connection per non‑exempt port.

In summary, while most of the formatting and block usage are acceptable, the duplicate connection on RLoad’s LConn1 and the misuse of the Voltage Sensor’s LConn1 (instead of RConn1 for its output) are errors that violate the simulation connection rules.

[Iteration 7] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • All blocks listed in the “blocks used in the simulation” appear in the connections description. No extra blocks were found.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are provided without the special character “/” and follow the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Every connection is formatted as “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” on each side of “<->”. No extra parameter explanations are provided. The formatting is correct.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No parameter settings were supplied, which is acceptable since none were required by the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • The Scope block (Scope) input port “1” is used twice (in connection 1 and connection 18). Since Scope is not an exception (only Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration may have duplicate input connections), this is an error.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The Voltage Sensor block is defined with a physical signal output on port RConn1 and two electrical conserving ports (LConn1 and RConn2). However, in connection 16 the Voltage Sensor’s LConn1 and in connection 17 its RConn2 are used on the left (output) side. This is incorrect because only RConn1 is intended for output, and the conserving ports should not serve as an output. This violates the expected assignment of output versus input ports.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Although nearly every block has its ports connected, the errors identified above (duplicate connection on Scope’s input and the misuse of the Voltage Sensor’s ports) cause violations in the one‐to‐one unique connection rule for non‐exempt input ports and in proper block connection types.

In summary, while most formatting aspects are correct, the simulation description contains errors: Scope’s input port “1” is connected twice, and the Voltage Sensor is used on inappropriate ports as output (using LConn1 and RConn2 instead of the designated output port RConn1).

[Iteration 8] Investigator reviewer result: Review Summary:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • All blocks from the “blocks used in the simulation” appear in the connections description (including the resistor blocks labeled R1, R2, RBias, RLoad). No extra blocks are found.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are provided without the special symbol “/” and follow the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Each connection strictly follows the “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format on both sides of the “<->” with no extraneous parameter explanations. This requirement is met.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No parameter settings were provided in any connection, which is acceptable given that none are required by the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • The connection “Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1 <-> Scope (Scope) 1” appears twice (connection 1 and connection 18). This duplicates an input connection on Scope’s port 1, which is not allowed except for the specified exceptions (Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration). Therefore, a duplicate connection error exists.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The outputs and inputs appear to be used in the prescribed order (left side as output, right side as input). No block that only has output is connected to another; similarly, blocks with only input aren’t used as outputs. However, the duplicate connection on Scope (non‐exempt) and the repeated use of Voltage sensor’s output port violate the unique connection rule.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • While each block has its ports connected, the duplicate use of Scope’s input port “1” violates the one‐to‐one connection requirement for non‐exempt blocks.

Conclusion: The description contains at least one clear error (a duplicate connection on Scope’s input port) which violates the simulation connection rules.

[Iteration 9] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block from the “blocks used in the simulation” list appears in the connection description. No extra blocks were found.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are formatted correctly without the special “/” character.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Each connection is presented in the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format on both sides of the “<->” with no additional parameter explanations. This requirement is met.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No parameter settings were provided, which is acceptable since none are required by the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • There is a duplicate connection issue on the resistor labeled RLoad. Its port LConn1 is used as the input in two separate connections (once in the connection  
  “Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) LConn2 <-> RLoad (Resistor) LConn1”  
  and again in “Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 <-> RLoad (Resistor) LConn1”).  
 • This violates the rule that – apart from Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration – no input port may be connected more than once.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The Voltage Sensor block is defined with a physical signal output on port RConn1. However, while one connection correctly uses RConn1 (“Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1 <-> Scope (Scope) 1”), two additional connections use its electrical conserving ports (LConn1 and RConn2) on the left (output) side (“Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) LConn1 <-> RLoad (Resistor) LConn1” and “Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn2 <-> Electrical Reference (Electrical Reference) LConn1”).  
 • This inconsistent usage of the Voltage Sensor’s ports (using ports not designated for output) is an error in block connection types.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • While most blocks have all their ports connected, the duplicate connection on the RLoad input and the misassignment of the Voltage Sensor’s output ports indicate that not every port is uniquely and correctly connected as required.

In summary, although the overall formatting and block listing are correct, there are errors: RLoad (Resistor) port LConn1 is connected as an input twice, and the Voltage Sensor is used incorrectly on its electrical conserving ports instead of its designated physical signal output (RConn1) in two of its connections.

[Iteration 10] Investigator reviewer result: Review Summary:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block from the “blocks used in the simulation” list (including the individual resistor blocks R1, R2, RBias, and RLoad) appears in the connection description. No extra blocks are present.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are given without the special “/” character and follow the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Every connection is strictly formatted as “BlockA (Real Block Name) PortX <-> BlockB (Real Block Name) PortY” with no extraneous explanation for parameter settings. This requirement is met.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No parameter settings are provided, which is acceptable because none are required by the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • Each input port (aside from the allowed exceptions, Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration) is connected only once. For example, although RLoad (Resistor) appears in two different connections, one instance uses its RConn1 as output (left side) and the other uses the same port as input (right side); thus no duplicate connection on the same input port is found.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • All connections follow the rule that the left side is the output port and the right side is the input port. The usage of conserving ports (which may be bidirectional in physical networks) is consistent with the simulation blocks list. There is no connection between blocks that only have outputs or only have inputs.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Each block has all its defined ports connected (for example, the Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source’s LConn1, RConn1, LConn2, and RConn2 are each connected; similarly, all ports for the other blocks are connected in one role or the other).

Conclusion: All requirements are met without any inconsistencies or errors.

[Debug Iteration 1] Debug locator result: Below is the analysis report:

1. Code segments likely causing the error:
 • The add_line call that connects the Voltage Sensor’s RConn1 to the Scope input is the first place where the problem occurs (line 26 in the script):
  eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage sensor/RConn1', 'Scope/1', nargout=0)
 • The nearby connection lines (for example, connecting AC Voltage Source to C1 and then chaining connections through Electrical Reference, RBias, etc.) depend on proper physical domain matching but are executed just before/after the offending line. Their ordering and dependency mean that if one physical-domain rule is violated (as with the Voltage Sensor ↔ Scope connection), the error is thrown.

2. Connection configuration and parameter integrity versus the Investigator’s details:
 • A review of the code shows that the block additions (with the same library paths and destination names) and the connection calls exactly follow the Investigator’s Implementation Details. For example, the Voltage Sensor is added as
  eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Sensors/Voltage Sensor', model_name + '/Voltage sensor', …)
 and later its RConn1 is connected to the Scope’s port “1” exactly as described.
 • All other inter-block connections (for AC Voltage Source, C1, RBias, etc.) match the mapping provided by the Investigator.
 • However, according to the Simscape physical modeling rules, the Voltage Sensor’s output (on RConn1) is a physical signal, whereas the Scope block (a standard Simulink block from the Commonly Used Blocks library) does not operate in the same physical modeling domain. That is why MATLAB is flagging that “points input cannot lie on objects that do not share the same Physical Modeling domain.”

3. Assessment and final recommendation:
 • The connection configuration and the port parameters in the code are in full agreement with the Investigator’s Implementation Details.
 • Because every connection (even the one violating the physical-domain rule) has been implemented exactly as specified, the error is not due to a code typo but arises from a discrepancy in the Investigator’s Implementation Details. The specification requires a connection between blocks that do not share the same physical modeling domain.
 • Therefore, no modifications to the code are recommended here; instead, the error must be resolved by revisiting the Investigator’s Implementation Details.

{
  "Investigator_error": True
}


[Debug Iteration 1] Investigator reviewer round1 result: Below is our revised review based on the Debug Locator’s analysis:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • All blocks originally listed appear in the connection description; no extra block is present.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • The block names are formatted correctly (without any “/” characters).

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • The connection description still strictly follows the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format with no unnecessary parameter text.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • Parameter settings are either not provided or are as specified; no issues are found in this regard.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • There are no duplicate connections based on input ports (other than allowed exceptions); this is unchanged.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • A critical issue has been identified. The Voltage Sensor’s RConn1 output (a physical signal in the Simscape physical modeling domain) is being connected to a Scope block’s input (which is a standard Simulink block and does not share the physical modeling domain). According to Simscape modeling rules, blocks in different physical modeling domains cannot be directly connected. This discrepancy in physical-domain alignment is the source of the runtime error.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Although every port appears connected as specified, the improper domain connection between the Voltage Sensor and the Scope violates physical-domain compatibility requirements.

Conclusion: While the formatting, parameter settings, and duplicate connection rules are correctly followed, the connection between the Voltage Sensor’s physical output and the Scope (a non-physical block) violates Simscape physical modeling rules. This discrepancy in block connection types causes the runtime error, so the overall implementation does not pass the revised unit tests.

[Iteration 11] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our revised review based on a reexamination of the simulation connections after the runtime errors:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • All blocks listed in the “blocks used in the simulation” (including the newly added PS‑Simulink Converter) appear in the connection description. No extra blocks were found.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are formatted correctly (none contain the “/” symbol).

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Every connection is provided in the required “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format. There are no extra parameter explanations. This aspect is correct.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No parameter settings were needed and none were provided; they conform to the simulation blocks list expectations.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • A duplicate connection has been identified: the connection  
  “R1 (Resistor) RConn1 <-> Current-Controlled Current source (Current-Controlled Current Source) RConn2” appears twice (once in connection 11 and again in connection 16).  
 • This violates the requirement that a non‐exempt input port be uniquely connected.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The PS‑Simulink Converter is intended to bridge physical and Simulink domains. However, its port LConn1 is used in two different roles (once as a target in the connection from Voltage Sensor and once as a source to Scope).  
 • This reusage (using the same port name for what should be distinct physical input and digital output boundaries) introduces a domain mismatch error since the Scope block does not reside in the same physical domain.  
 • Therefore, the configuration for the PS‑Simulink Converter connection is inconsistent with physical modeling rules.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Every block appears to have all its ports connected; however, the duplicate connection on R1 and the improper configuration of the PS‑Simulink Converter prevent the overall network from meeting unique, valid domain‐correct connectivity.

Conclusion:
While the overall formatting, block names, and many connection parameters are correct, there are two significant issues:
– A duplicate connection exists for R1’s RConn1 to the Current‑Controlled Current source’s RConn2.
– The PS‑Simulink Converter is incorrectly configured, using its same port (LConn1) for both receiving a physical signal and providing a digital output to the Scope, which causes a domain mismatch error.

[Iteration 12] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our revised review following the Debug Locator report and reexamination:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • All blocks listed in the “blocks used in the simulation” (including the new PS‑Simulink Converter) appear in the connections description. There are no extra blocks.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are correctly formatted without the special “/” symbol.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Every connection is strictly formatted as “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” on each side of “<->” with no additional parameter explanation. This requirement is met.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No explicit parameter settings are provided; this is consistent with the simulation blocks list.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • No duplicate connections (that is, the same block’s same non‐exempt input port used more than once) are detected. Although several blocks (e.g., Electrical Reference) receive multiple connections, they are allowed exceptions.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • A critical issue is present with the PS‑Simulink Converter. Its port LConn1 is used in two roles: In the first connection the Voltage Sensor’s RConn1 (physical signal output) is connected to PS‑Simulink Converter LConn1 (acting as an input), while in the second connection the same PS‑Simulink Converter LConn1 is used on the left side as an output to the Scope. This dual use of the same physical port on the PS‑Simulink Converter – once as an input and again as an output – violates valid connection type requirements, since a given port must have a consistent role. In addition, connecting the physical-domain output of the Voltage Sensor through a converter that reuses the same port for conversion and output to a standard Simulink block (Scope) creates a domain mismatch issue.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • While every block has an associated connection, the improper configuration of the PS‑Simulink Converter means that the intended one-to-one mapping of ports (with unique roles) is not fully achieved.

Conclusion: Although all blocks are present and connection descriptions are well formatted, the PS‑Simulink Converter’s port LConn1 is used inconsistently (serving as both input and output), which violates the valid block connection type rules and causes domain mismatch issues. Therefore, the overall configuration does not pass the unit tests.

[Iteration 13] Investigator reviewer result: Below is our complete review:

1. Extra Blocks  
 • Every block specified in the “blocks used in the simulation” (including the PS‑Simulink Converter) appears in the connection description. No extra blocks are present.

2. Formatting of Block Names  
 • All block names are presented without the special “/” character and correctly follow the “BlockLabel (Real Block Name) Port” format.

3. Formatting of Connection Description  
 • Each connection is formatted as required (e.g., “Voltage sensor (Voltage Sensor) RConn1 <-> PS‑Simulink Converter (PS‑Simulink Converter) LConn1”) with no extraneous parameter explanation. The format is correct.

4. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections  
 • No explicit parameter settings were provided, which is consistent with the simulation blocks list expectations.

5. Detect Duplicate Connections  
 • No non‐exempt input port is connected more than once. Although Electrical Reference and Solver Configuration receive multiple connections (which is allowed), no duplicate connection occurs on any other block’s same input port.

6. Validate Block Connection Types  
 • The connections respect the rule that the left side is the output and the right side is the input. For instance, the PS‑Simulink Converter is used to bridge a physical signal (from Voltage Sensor’s RConn1) to the digital domain (Scope’s input) via its defined ports. In all cases, each block’s specified port is used in a proper role.

7. Verify Complete Port Connections  
 • Each block’s ports are connected as defined by the simulation blocks list. For example, the Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source’s LConn1, RConn1, LConn2, and RConn2 are all connected; similarly, each port for the other blocks, including the converter and sensors, is accounted for in the connections description.

Overall, all our investigation criteria are met with proper block usage, correct formatting, valid parameter settings, no disallowed duplicate connections, correct connection types, and complete port connectivity.

 Simulation report: Below is the comprehensive report that integrates theoretical analysis with a complete code explanation, organized according to the four key questions.

─────────────────────────────  
1. What Is the Simulation About?  
─────────────────────────────  
This simulation models a small-signal bipolar transistor amplifier—specifically, a common-emitter configuration using a BC107 Group B transistor. The purpose is to evaluate the small-signal behavior and performance (gain, biasing, frequency response) of the amplifier. By replacing the transistor with its hybrid-parameter equivalent circuit (using h_ie, h_oe, h_fe, and h_re parameters) along with associated passive elements (such as resistor bias networks and a decoupling capacitor), the simulation reproduces real-world operation. The bias resistor (47K) sets the operating point, and the load resistor (470 Ω) along with the controlled sources represent the transistor’s amplification characteristics. Furthermore, the decoupling capacitor (1 µF) is selected to have negligible impedance at the operating frequency (1 kHz), ensuring that the expected voltage gain of approximately –47 (i.e., an output voltage of 0.47 V peak for a 10 mV input) is achieved. In effect, the simulation replicates and verifies the behavior of a typical analog transistor amplifier circuit under small-signal conditions.

─────────────────────────────  
2. What Are the Main Simulation Steps?  
─────────────────────────────  
The simulation is structured into a sequence of functional modules or steps that collectively represent the real circuit:

A. Environment and Block Initialization  
 • Create a new simulation system and set up the solver configuration along with an electrical ground.  

B. Signal Source and Passive Component Setup  
 • Add an AC voltage source to serve as the small-signal input.  
 • Incorporate a capacitor (decoupling element) connecting the voltage source to the bias network.  
 • Add the bias resistor (RBias) to set the transistor’s operating point by connecting to the electrical reference (ground).

C. Transistor Model via Controlled Sources and Resistors  
 • Emulate the transistor using a Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source block for input-to-output voltage mapping and a Current-Controlled Current Source block for current relationships.  
 • Connect dedicated resistors (R1 and R2) which represent the small-signal equivalent impedance and feed the controlled sources.

D. Load and Measurement Circuit  
 • Attach the load resistor (RLoad) to simulate the output loading condition and to complete the biasing of the transistor model.  
 • Insert a Voltage Sensor block into the output node to capture the amplified signal.

E. Signal Conversion and Visualization  
 • Use a Physical-to-Simulink (PS-Simulink) Converter to transform the physical voltage signal from the Electrical Domain into a Simulink signal.  
 • Connect this output to a Scope block for visualizing the time-domain waveform.

F. Interconnection and Simulation Arrangement  
 • Connect all blocks following the electrical circuit’s topology (including controlled source connections and ground reference) to maintain physical consistency and signal flow.

─────────────────────────────  
3. What Theoretical Knowledge and Mathematical Modelling Are Involved in Each Step?  
─────────────────────────────  

A. Environment and Block Initialization  
 – The simulation uses the principles of circuit topology and network theory. The Solver Configuration block provides the physical network environment based on the laws of conservation (Kirchhoff’s laws) and the selection of numerical solvers for differential algebraic equations (DAEs).  
 – Electrical reference (ground) ensures a common voltage reference for all elements.

B. Signal Source and Passive Component Setup  
 – AC Voltage Source: Represents a sinusoidal input signal given by V(t) = V₀ sin(2πft + φ), which is rooted in harmonic analysis and signal theory.  
 – Capacitor: Modeled by the relation I(t) = C dV/dt. It provides frequency-dependent behavior that on decoupling minimizes the impedance at the operating frequency (1 kHz) following principles of impedance in the frequency domain.  
 – Resistor (RBias): Follows Ohm’s law V = I × R. Its role in biasing is analyzed via DC Thevenin equivalents in small-signal analysis.

C. Transistor Model via Controlled Sources and Resistors  
 – Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source: Models the voltage gain behavior. In this case, it is defined by V = K (V(+) − V(–)), embodying the small-signal gain of the transistor (the approximate gain is –h_fe*RLoad/h_ie).  
 – Current-Controlled Current Source: Provides a mathematical representation of current amplification with I₂ = K I₁, reflecting the current gain properties of the transistor.  
 – Resistors (R1 and R2): Represent the hybrid parameters (h_ie and the impedance at the output node). Their interconnection is derived from linear circuit theory.

D. Load and Measurement Circuit  
 – Load resistor (RLoad): Applies Ohm’s law and represents the output load on the amplifier.  
 – Voltage Sensor: Implements the measurement theory by converting the voltage difference at its terminals into a measurable signal. This process is fundamental in both instrumentation and sensor theory.

E. Signal Conversion and Visualization  
 – PS-Simulink Converter ensures that signals modeled using physical (Simscape) dynamics are converted to data formats that the Simulink environment can process, bridging the gap between physical modelling (differential equations) and digital signal visualization.  
 – The Scope block then uses time-domain signal analysis concepts to display the resulting waveform.

─────────────────────────────  
4. How Is It Implemented in Code?  
─────────────────────────────  
The simulation is constructed using a Python script that employs MATLAB’s engine interface to automate the process of building and connecting Simscape blocks. The code below is organized corresponding to the simulation steps outlined above.

A. Environment and Block Initialization  

 The code starts a new MATLAB system, sets up the simulation environment, and includes solver configuration and electrical reference blocks, which are necessary for ensuring that the physical circuit is solved consistently.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------  
 import sys
 sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/matlabengine-24.2-py3.10.egg')

 eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Electrical Reference', model_name + '/Electrical Reference', nargout=0)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------  

B. Signal Source and Passive Component Setup  

 Next, an AC Voltage Source is added. Its connection to the decoupling capacitor (C1) and the bias resistor (RBias) ensure that the input is filtered and the DC bias condition is set. This step incorporates harmonic signal theory and impedance matching.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 eng.add_line(model_name, 'RBias/RConn1', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------  

C. Transistor Model via Controlled Sources and Resistors  

 The small-signal transistor is modelled using a Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) and a Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS). Additional resistors (R1 and R2) are included to emulate the transistor’s h-parameter behavior. This section reflects the theory of controlled sources where the output is a linear function of the input signals.

 # R2 to ground
 eng.add_line(model_name, 'R2/RConn1', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------  

D. Load and Measurement Circuit  

 The load resistor (RLoad) is added to simulate the load condition on the output of the amplifier, and a Voltage Sensor is connected across it to monitor the output voltage. This measurement setup follows Ohm’s law and sensor instrumentation theory.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------  
 # Add load resistor and voltage sensor
 eng.add_block('fl_lib/Electrical/Electrical Elements/Resistor', model_name + '/RLoad', nargout=0)

 eng.add_line(model_name, 'Voltage sensor/RConn2', 'Electrical Reference/LConn1', nargout=0)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------  

E. Signal Conversion and Visualization  

 To view the simulation’s output, the Voltage Sensor’s physical signal is converted using a PS-Simulink Converter block that provides a Simulink-compatible signal which is then displayed in a Scope block.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------  
 # Add PS-Simulink Converter and Scope for visualization
 eng.add_block('nesl_utility/PS-Simulink Converter', model_name + '/PS-Simulink Converter', nargout=0)
 eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Scope', model_name + '/Scope', nargout=0)

 # Connect Voltage Sensor output to PS-Simulink Converter and then to Scope

Conclusion  
─────────────────────────────  
The simulation methodically constructs a small-signal common-emitter transistor amplifier model. Beginning with environmental setup (solver and ground), progressing through input signal conditioning and passive component integration, then modeling the transistor with controlled sources and associated resistors, and finally providing an output measurement and visualization channel, the simulation is underpinned by robust electrical circuit theory and mathematical modeling. The implementation in MATLAB via a Python script not only creates individual blocks using Simscape but also precisely interconnects them to reflect the theoretical circuit design, thereby ensuring that the simulation output (observed on the Scope) accurately represents the desired amplifier performance.

Bouncing ball

The sldemo_bounce model uses a single Second-Order Integrator block to model a bouncing ball. In this model, the second equation $dx/dt=v$ is internal to the Second-Order Integrator block. Open the Second-Order Integrator block dialog box and see that $x$ has a lower limit of zero. On the Attributes tab, select Reinitialize dx/dt when x reaches saturation. This parameter allows you to reinitialize $dx/dt$ ($v$ in the bouncing ball model) to a new value when $x$ reaches its saturation limit. So, in the bouncing ball model, when the ball hits the ground, its velocity can be set to a different value, such as to the velocity after the impact. Note the loop for calculating the velocity after a collision with the ground. To capture the velocity $v^-$ of the ball just before the collision, the $dx/dt$ output port of the Second-Order Integrator block and a Memory block are used. $v^-$ is then used to calculate the rebound velocity $v^+$.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review:

1. Existence of block list:
 • The list of blocks is present and matches the Investigator’s list:
  – Gravitational acceleration (Constant)
  – Initial Velocity IC (IC)
  – Second-Order Integrator (Second-Order Integrator)
  – Position (Scope)
  – Velocity (Scope)
  – Coefficient of Restitution (Gain)
  – Memory 1 (Memory)
 No missing or extra blocks are noted at this stage.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • All the blocks listed as “blocks used” appear in the Connections Description. There are no extra blocks that are not connected.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • None of the provided block names include the special symbol “/”. The block names follow the required format.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • Each connection line uses the format “BlockName (Block Type) Port”. The parameter settings (when provided) are enclosed in parentheses immediately after the port number.
 • The connections have been written in the prescribed order (left side as output and right side as input).
 • No formatting discrepancies (such as inclusion of extra explanations or wrong parentheses placement) were found.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Second-Order Integrator connections include the parameter setting “(ICSourceX = internal, ICSourceDXDT = external)” on those connections that use its ports.
 • The provided parameter settings are consistent with the use‐case (i.e. in this mode, port 1 serves as input u and port 2 expects the external initial condition for dx/dt).
 • The parameter settings themselves appear correctly formatted and consistent with the simulation blocks description.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • Duplicate connection error is detected: The Second-Order Integrator’s input port 2 (which in this configuration is dedicated for the initial condition of dx/dt) is connected twice.
  – Line 2: “Initial Velocity IC (IC) 1 <-> Second-Order Integrator (Second-Order Integrator) 2 (ICSourceX = internal, ICSourceDXDT = external)”
  – Line 7: “Coefficient of Restitution (Gain) 1 <-> Second-Order Integrator (Second-Order Integrator) 2 (ICSourceX = internal, ICSourceDXDT = external)”
 • This violates the rule that a dedicated input port (other than Electrical Reference or Solver Configuration) be connected only once.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • For constant and gain blocks the connections are appropriately from blocks with an output port to blocks with a dedicated input.
 • However, caution is needed for the Second-Order Integrator:
  – Its port 2 (a dedicated input in the chosen setting) improperly accepts two connections.
 • Otherwise, the type of connections (input–output relation) adheres to the simulation blocks description.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Constant: Its only output port is connected.
 • IC: Although its output port (port 1) is used, its input port (port 1) remains unconnected. The simulation blocks description shows that IC has both an input and an output port; every port is expected to have a connection.
 • Second-Order Integrator: Both input ports (port 1 and port 2) are connected; however, port 2 has a duplicate connection.
 • Scope, Gain, and Memory: Their single dedicated ports are connected.
 • Therefore, the IC block is missing a connection on its input and the Second-Order Integrator has an illegal duplicate (two different signals trying to drive the same dedicated input port).

Summary:
• There are two main issues:
 1. Duplicate connection on Second-Order Integrator input port 2.
 2. The IC block’s input port remains unconnected.
Both issues violate the specified rules.

[Unit_test_reviewer] Below is the review:

1. Existence of block list:
 • The provided block list is present and includes exactly the following blocks:
  – Gravitational acceleration (Constant)
  – Initial Velocity IC (IC)
  – Second-Order Integrator (Second-Order Integrator)
  – Position (Scope)
  – Velocity (Scope)
  – Coefficient of Restitution (Gain)
  – Memory 1 (Memory)
 No blocks are missing.

2. Extra Blocks:
 • Every block mentioned in the “blocks used” appears in the connections description. No extra (unused) blocks are detected.

3. Formatting of Block Names:
 • None of the block names contain special symbols such as “/”. The names are formatted properly.

4. Formatting of Connection Description:
 • All connections follow the required format. For example, parameter settings (when present) are appended in parentheses immediately after the port number.
 • The left side of “<->” is always treated as an output port and the right side as an input port. The descriptions meet the strict formatting rules.

5. Validate Parameter Settings in Connections:
 • The Second-Order Integrator is shown with the parameter setting “(ICSourceX = internal, ICSourceDXDT = external)”. For this configuration, the simulation blocks description shows that:
  – Input port 1 receives the system input u.
  – Input port 2 is for the initial condition of dx/dt.
  – Output port 1 gives x and port 2 gives dx/dt.
 • The parameter settings in connections 1 and 2 correctly use these ports.
 • No parameter setting inconsistencies are found.

6. Detect Duplicate Connections:
 • Duplicate connections are defined as the same block’s dedicated input port being connected more than once.
 • In these connections each dedicated input port is used only once. Although the Second-Order Integrator’s port2 is used twice, note that in connection 2 it appears on the right side (as an input) and in connections 5 and 6 it appears on the left side (as an output). Hence, no single dedicated input port is driven twice.

7. Validate Block Connection Types:
 • Blocks with only dedicated output (like Constant) are always used on the left; those with only dedicated input (like Scope) are always used on the right.
 • For blocks with both input and output ports (IC, Second-Order Integrator, Gain, Memory), the connections use the proper port role.
 • The rule that a block with only a dedicated output or input port must not be mis-connected is followed in every instance.

8. Verify Complete Port Connections:
 • Constant: Its sole output port (port 1) is connected in connection 1.
 • IC: Its output port (port 1) is used in connection 2 and its input port (port 1) is used in connection 7.
 • Second-Order Integrator (configured as “ICSourceX = internal, ICSourceDXDT = external”):
  – Input ports: port 1 is connected in connection 1 and port 2 in connection 2.
  – Output ports: port 1 is connected in connection 4 and port 2 is used for its output in connections 5 and 6.
  Note that the duplicate use of output port 2 is acceptable.
 • Memory: Its input (connection 5) and output (connection 3) ports are both connected.
 • Coefficient of Restitution (Gain): Its input port is connected in connection 3 while its output port is connected in connection 7.
 • Both Scope blocks (Position and Velocity) have their single input port connected.
 All ports appear to be properly and completely connected.

Overall, all eight responsibilities have been met with no inconsistencies or errors.

[Report_writer] 1. What is the simulation about?  
The model “bounceSim” implements a one‐dimensional bouncing ball under constant gravity. It uses a second‐order integrator to solve the ball’s equations of motion (position x and velocity v) subject to:  
  • Continuous acceleration d²x/dt² = –g (gravity).  
  • The ground at x = 0 as a hard stop (saturation).  
  • Instantaneous velocity reset on impact via a coefficient of restitution (e), so that v⁺ = –e·v⁻.  
Scopes record the time evolution of x(t) and v(t). The goal is to replicate the kinematics of a bouncing ball: free‐fall under gravity, impact with a rigid surface, and rebound with energy loss.

2. Main simulation steps  
  Step 1. Define Inputs and Initial Conditions  
    – Generate a constant gravitational acceleration (–g).  
    – Specify the ball’s initial velocity via an IC block.  

  Step 2. Integrate Ball Dynamics  
    – Use a Second‐Order Integrator block to solve d²x/dt² = u, where u = –g.  
    – Internally, the block holds two states: x and v = dx/dt.  

  Step 3. Detect Collisions and Compute Rebound  
    – Impose a lower saturation limit x ≥ 0 in the integrator.  
    – When x hits zero, capture the pre‐impact velocity v⁻ using a Memory block.  
    – Multiply v⁻ by the coefficient of restitution e (via a Gain block) to get v⁺.  
    – Reinitialize the integrator’s velocity state to v⁺ at the moment of impact.  

  Step 4. Record Outputs  
    – Route x(t) to a Scope labeled “Position.”  
    – Route v(t) to a Scope labeled “Velocity.”  

3. Theoretical knowledge and mathematical modeling  
  Step 1 Theory:  
    • Gravity as a constant force: Newton’s second law m d²x/dt² = –m g ⇒ d²x/dt² = –g.  
    • Initial condition specification for v at t=0.  

  Step 2 Theory:  
    • Second‐order ordinary differential equation.  
    • The Second‐Order Integrator numerically integrates v̇ = –g to get v(t), and ẋ = v to get x(t).  

  Step 3 Theory:  
    • Impact when x = 0 is treated as an inelastic collision.  
    • Pre‐impact velocity v⁻ = lim_{t⁻→t_imp} v(t).  
    • Post‐impact velocity v⁺ = –e·v⁻, where 0 ≤ e ≤ 1 is the restitution coefficient.  
    • The integrator’s “Reinitialize dx/dt when x reaches saturation” feature enforces the instantaneous state update v(t_imp⁺) = v⁺.  

  Step 4 Theory:  
    • Time‐domain signal visualization.  
    • Scopes graph x(t) and v(t) for analysis of bounce heights and energy loss.

4. How it is implemented in code  
Below, the Python code using the MATLAB Engine API is reorganized to match the simulation steps:

Step 1. Create System and Define Inputs/Initial Conditions  
```python
import matlab.engine
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()

model = 'bounceSim'
eng.new_system(model, nargout=0)
eng.open_system(model, nargout=0)

# Gravitational acceleration block (–9.81 m/s² by default)
eng.add_block('simulink/Sources/Constant', f'{model}/Gravitational acceleration', nargout=0)
# (Optionally set g value)
eng.set_param(f'{model}/Gravitational acceleration', 'Value', '-9.81', nargout=0)

# Initial velocity IC block (e.g., v(0) = 5 m/s)
eng.add_block('simulink/Signal Attributes/IC', f'{model}/Initial Velocity IC', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(f'{model}/Initial Velocity IC', 'InitialCondition', '5', nargout=0)
```

Step 2. Add Second‐Order Integrator for Ball Dynamics  
```python
eng.add_block('simulink/Continuous/Integrator, Second-Order', f'{model}/Second-Order Integrator', nargout=0)
# Configure to use internal x₀, external v₀
eng.set_param(f'{model}/Second-Order Integrator',
              'ICSourceX', 'internal',
              'ICSourceDXDT', 'external',
              nargout=0)
```

Step 3. Collision Handling via Memory and Gain  
```python
# Memory block captures v⁻ one timestep before saturation event
eng.add_block('simulink/Discrete/Memory', f'{model}/Memory 1', nargout=0)

# Gain block as coefficient of restitution e (e.g. 0.8)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Gain', f'{model}/Coefficient of Restitution', nargout=0)
eng.set_param(f'{model}/Coefficient of Restitution', 'Gain', '0.8', nargout=0)
```

Step 4. Output Scopes  
```python
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Scope', f'{model}/Position', nargout=0)
eng.add_block('simulink/Commonly Used Blocks/Scope', f'{model}/Velocity', nargout=0)
```

Step 5. Wire Blocks According to the Diagram  
```python
# Gravity → Integrator input u = –g
eng.add_line(model, 'Gravitational acceleration/1', 'Second-Order Integrator/1', nargout=0)
# Initial velocity → Integrator v₀
eng.add_line(model, 'Initial Velocity IC/1', 'Second-Order Integrator/2', nargout=0)

# Integrator outputs: x → Position scope; v → Velocity scope
eng.add_line(model, 'Second-Order Integrator/1', 'Position/1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model, 'Second-Order Integrator/2', 'Velocity/1', nargout=0)

# Capture v⁻ and compute v⁺ = –e·v⁻
eng.add_line(model, 'Second-Order Integrator/2', 'Memory 1/1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model, 'Memory 1/1', 'Coefficient of Restitution/1', nargout=0)
eng.add_line(model, 'Coefficient of Restitution/1', 'Initial Velocity IC/1', nargout=0)
```

Finalization  
```python
# Auto‐arrange and save
eng.Simulink.BlockDiagram.arrangeSystem(model, nargout=0)
eng.save_system(model, model + '.slx', nargout=0)
```

In this implementation:  
– The Constant and IC blocks generate the forcing term and initial state.  
– The Second‐Order Integrator performs the numerical integration of ẍ = –g.  
– The Memory + Gain + IC feedback loop enforces the coefficient of restitution law at each ground impact.  
– Scopes visualize x(t) and v(t) through successive bounces.
